1. Introduction<br><br>
Widely hailed as an educational success story, Singapore, a multilingual island nation in Southeast Asia, embraces an officially bilingual education policy. English is the medium of all content-area education from the start of schooling, with students’ official “mother tongue” required as a single subject. Although called the student’s “mother tongue,” these languages may not be the student’s home language, resulting in many students studying two non-native languages in school. I will address the following questions in this paper: What assumptions about second language acquisition, bilingualism and language planning underlie Singapore’s bilingual education policy? How does the case of Singapore illuminate current theories in second language acquisition and language planning?<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">2. Singapore’s bilingual education policy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>


Singapore is comprised of three major ethnic groups in the following proportions: Chinese 77%, Malays 14% and Indians 8%. These proportions have remained stable since around 1900 (Chua 1964). In 1959 when Singapore gained self-rule from Britain, Singapore chose to become an officially multilingual state, selecting four official languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil. English is promoted as the “working language” of Singapore for inter-ethnic communication, while the other official languages are considered “mother tongues” of the major ethnic groups.
The choice of these “mother tongues” is interesting. At independence in 1965, virtually no ethnic Chinese in Singapore spoke Mandarin as their predominant home language (Afendras and Kuo 1980). Additionally, only 60% of Indians in Singapore in 1957 spoke Tamil as their home language. Only Malays were assigned a mother tongue that corresponded to the language they spoke at home.<br><br>
In 1966, parents could choose education through any one of the four official languages (English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) but all students also had to study one of the other official languages, English for students in the non-English-medium schools (Yip, Eng and Yap 1990). The government then required all schools to teach math and science in English starting with first grade. By 1979, parents stopped enrolling their children in Malay- and Tamil-medium schools, and Chinese-medium enrollment was down to about 10% of the entering cohort. The government then adopted the bilingual education policy that is, with a few modifications, currently in place: All students study their subject-matter curriculum through the medium of English, but they are also required to reach a “second-language” level of proficiency in their official mother tongue C Mandarin for Chinese, Malay for Malays and Tamil for Dravidian-speaking Indians.<br><br>
More recently, for Indians who speak Indo-European languages at home, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Urdu and Gujarati are offered as options for mother tongue study in “community-run weekend … classes” (Saravanan 1999, p. 174). With an area only 3.5 times the size of Washington, DC (CIA 2001), Singapore’s diminutive size and public-transit infrastructure allows for easy consolidation of students who speak lower-incidence Indian languages for instruction. Though the government offers these languages as subjects in the national examinations, it does not fund or provide facilities, teachers, or teacher training for classes in these non-official languages (Kaur and On 2001).

	<b><a name="T3">3. Does it work?: educational outcomes in Singapore</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Singapore’s education system has been hailed as a great success due to its first-place mean score in math (Mullis et al. 1999) and second-place in science (Martin et al. 1999) compared to 38 countries on IEA’s Third International Math and Science Study-Repeat (TIMSS-R). A total of 4966 Secondary 2 (8th-grade) students from all Singapore schools participated (Mullis et al. 1999). Students from all streams, including the Normal-Technical stream, were represented (Ministry of Education 2001b). Only 27% of Singapore’s students reported “always using the language of the test (i.e. English) at home” (Ministry of Education 2001b), while three-quarters of participating countries had 80% or more of their students speaking the language of the test at home. The TIMSS-R results confirmed Singapore’s high scores from the previous TIMSS in 1995.<br><br>
Since TIMSS (1995) tested grades 3, 4, 7 and 8, it was possible to track how the P4 cohort performed four years later, at Secondary 2 (grade 8, the only grade tested by TIMSS-R). The Singaporean P4 cohort held its top rank in mathematics by S2; however, they improved their science score from about average to the top (Ministry of Education 2001b). Besides looking at the mean score, TIMSS analyzed the proportion of students that reached international benchmarks. For Singapore, about one-third of its students reached the top 10% benchmark, with two-thirds at the upper-quarter benchmark and fully 90% of their students at the median benchmark. Virtually all Singaporeans reached at least the lower-quarter benchmark. In other words, 90% of Singapore’s students did as well or better than half of the students in all other participating countries combined. Strict standards for population selection, testing conditions and quality control were observed by IEA in order to ensure the best possible comparison across nations (Martin, Hoyle and Gregory 1996).
Judging from the TIMSS results, most Singaporean students seem to master English well enough to learn math and science content at a high level of achievement. But how do Singaporean students fare in tests of English language skills themselves?<br><br>
The thirty-five country IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2001, which tested 10-year-olds (with four years of schooling) on reading for literary purposes and reading for informational purposes, provides an interesting source of evidence of Singaporean students’ English reading skills (Mullis et al. 2003). Overall, Singapore’s Primary 4 (P4) students scored significantly higher than the international average and fifteen countries, not significantly different from Scotland, New Zealand and six other nations, and significantly lower than England, the United States and nine other countries. For both literary and informational purposes, Singapore performed significantly better than 15 countries, and did not significantly differ from eleven and twelve countries, respectively, including the US on reading for informational purposes. Singapore, at 43%, was one of only four countries in which less than half of their students “always” or “almost always” spoke the language of the test at home. Despite the status of English as a non-native language for the majority of Singaporean students, Singapore’s scores compare favorably to countries in which the majority of students speak the language of instruction at home.<br><br>
The international comparisons do not compare the different ethnic groups within Singapore. Singapore’s Ministry of Education releases some of its own exam results by ethnicity. On the Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE), required of all students after six years of elementary education, overall 97.7% of Singaporean students in the top (EM1) and middle (EM2) streams passed in 2001 (Ministry of Education 2002), with little variability by ethnic group (95.7% of Malays, 98.0% of Chinese and 98.2% of Indians). In other words, for the approximately 95% of Singaporean students who make it into the regular and elite tracks for upper primary school, virtually all of them pass their English exam, regardless of ethnicity. This would indicate that English may function as a “neutral” language, giving no ethnic group an advantage, at least at the primary level. Students in the lowest (EM3) stream take a “Foundation English” exam and are not included in this figure; this group probably includes a disproportionate percentage of Malays and Indians, as reflected by differing PSLE pass rates.<br><br>
What happens at the secondary level? Since 1995, over 60% percent of students from Primary 6 each year entered the “Special” or “Express” streams. Since 1998, an additional 50% or so of the “Normal” stream students took the Cambridge O-levels1 after a fifth year of study. O-level results, therefore, already exclude the bottom 20% of students. Despite this exclusion, a disparity between the ethnic groups exists on the English exam (see Figure 1), which includes oral, aural, reading comprehension, vocabulary and writing components. Over the years, Indians have consistently out-performed other ethnic groups on the English O-level exam (Ministry of Education 1997); in 2001, about 87% of Indians passed English, whereas 80.4% of Chinese and only 70.9% of Malays passed (Ministry of Education 2002). All ethnic groups have improved their pass rates since 1988 (Ministry of Education 1997; Ministry of Education 2002), with the gap between the ethnic groups narrowing as well.<br><br>

Only the most academically able prepare for A-level exams, the top 30% of O-level takers (Ministry of Education 2001a). Most students do not take the English literature exam, but all must pass the General Paper (GP), technically an “AO”-level exam, to qualify for university. The GP consists of general English reading comprehension questions with one long essay on a social or political topic, so GP results may be used as a measure of English reading and writing skills. At this high level, all three ethnic groups post high pass rates. Since 1991, 80-85% of Malays, 90-96% of Indians, and 86-92% of Chinese have passed their GP (see Figure 1). For Chinese and Indians, achievement seems to have leveled off after a decline from highs in 1994, whereas Malay performance has fluctuated with a tentative upward trend since 1994 interrupted by a major dip in 2000.<br><br>


In general, Singapore’s national exams show usually upward trends for all ethnic groups, but with an achievement gap between the majority Chinese and the Malay and Indian minority groups (Ministry of Education 2002). Although Chinese consistently perform better overall and a greater proportion move on to each higher level of education compared to the Malays and Indians, each ethnic group shows strength in different areas. The Malays outperform Chinese and Indians on their “mother tongue” exams; Indians perform better on the English exams; and Chinese perform better on the math and science exams.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T4">4. Second language acquisition assumptions underlying Singapore’s policy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Many implicit, and some explicit, assumptions concerning second language acquisition and bilingualism underlie Singapore’s bilingual education policy. Most of these assumptions are based on commonly-accepted views of language learning. Below I will show how Singapore’s policy is based on or reflects each assumption in turn.<br><br>
4.1 Beginning a second language early leads to higher proficiency
Singapore’s policy of emphasizing L2, English, from the beginning of formal schooling clearly stems from a belief that children will learn English better the earlier they start learning the language. Lee Kuan Yew, main architect of the education policy, made this assumption explicit:<br><br>
Language is a key to the acquisition of knowledge. If a student is unable to understand a language, then he is unable to receive information or knowledge in that language. It is therefore crucial that a breakthrough must be made in the English language as early in life as possible (Straits Times, May 29, 1982, as cited in Platt 1982, p. 31).<br><br>
This statement was part of a speech urging Malays to increase their use of English in order to improve the educational achievement of their children. This assumption is also shared widely by parents, who send their children to English-medium preschool programs to prepare them for the English-language demands of primary school (Sharpe, 1997). In the next section I will relate this assumption to the theory in second language acquisition.<br><br>
4.2 Home language development is not academically helpful to development of English language skills
As indicated above, Lee Kuan Yew believed the path to academic success in English was to use English more. In the above-cited speech, Lee expands on this idea:<br><br>
Parents have to decide on the trade-off between the convenience of speaking in Malay or the mother tongue at home with their children at the cost of EL1 [English studied at a “first language” level]. If they want their children to do well in EL1, their children must also, besides Malay, speak English at home (Platt 1982, p. 32).<br><br>
Although Lee does not go so far as suggesting a total switch in household use from Malay to English, he clearly indicates that greater home use of English, rather than further development of Malay language skills, will lead to academic success in English. Thus, although Singapore’s education policy is bilingual by requiring study of the student’s official “mother tongue” as a subject within English-medium schooling, the two languages are kept separate and proficiency in one is not considered helpful in gaining proficiency in the other. Further, when the policy began, only Malays were guaranteed study in their actual home language; a majority of Chinese and many Indian students studied their official “mother tongue” which was not in fact their home language. For Chinese in particular, the government did not consider development of the Chinese “dialects” usually spoken at home as helpful for gaining proficiency in either English or Mandarin Chinese; rather, dialects were seen as an impediment to learning the official languages and were targeted for elimination (Lee 2000; Newman 1988; Riney 1998).<br><br>
4.3 More time devoted to learning a language will result in greater proficiency in the language
When Singapore still used four languages as media of instruction, English was taught as the common L2 in the non-English-medium language streams. When the students were not achieving a high level of proficiency in English, the government required mathematics and science to be taught through the medium of English at all schools (Yip, Eng and Yap 1990). Although the landmark Report on the Ministry of Education (Goh 1979) cited evidence that this strategy was not improving students’ English proficiency and in fact had led to a decline in science achievement among Chinese-medium students, Lee Kuan Yew specifically took exception to this finding in his response to the report:<br><br>
Your team concluded that LET [Language Exposure Time] did not improve standards of English in Chinese-stream schools although Science and Mathematics were taught in English…. This is contrary to my own learning experience and my personal observations of students. The more you hear a language spoken, the easier it is for you to understand and to speak it…. (Goh 1979, p. vi).<br><br>
Lee holds on to the assumption that it is time on task rather than quality of input that is key to learning a language. Faced with poor English results, teaching methods were not overhauled; rather, the amount of time devoted to English was increased.<br><br>
4.4 Learning to read both an alphabetic and a logographic writing system is more difficult than learning to read in two alphabetic languages
When multiple language streams were abandoned in favor of English as the medium of instruction, a “monolingual” stream was proposed for students who could not handle the demands of learning two languages. The objective of this stream was to ensure that students become literate in at least one language, with some oral proficiency in L2. The choice of this language was different for the different language groups:<br><br>
Pupils with an English, Malay or Indian speaking home environment should be taught mainly in EL [English Language]. It would not be difficult for the Malays and Indians to learn the English Language because of the similarities between Malay/Tamil and English. Romanised Malay uses the same alphabet as English. Malay and Tamil are both phonetic languages unlike Chinese. Pupils with a Chinese home environment should be taught mainly CL [Chinese Language] with some oral English (Goh 1979, p. 6-2).<br><br>
Although this “monolingual” stream was later abandoned in favor of the EM3 stream C English as a first language for these students with only oral mother tongue C the assumption remains that Chinese students have an added “burden” of learning two very different writing systems. Another manifestation of this assumption is the additional resources allocated to the top-stream students who study Chinese and English at the highest levels in the so-called “Special Assistance Plan” schools (Gopinathan 1999).<br><br>
4.5 Ability to learn more than one language is related to general education achievement<br><br>
Students in Singapore are currently “streamed” (tracked) at the end of their Primary 4 (~4th grade) year according to their achievement in the first four years of formal schooling (Gopinathan 1999). Their achievement in all subjects is examined, not just language results. Only the top 20% of students are admitted to the elite “EM1” bilingual stream, where students learn both English and Chinese at a “first language” level in primary school. The majority of students are placed in the “EM2” stream, where all subjects are learned through the medium of English and the mother tongue is learned as a subject at the “second language” level. For these students, average academic achievement overall means a limited opportunity to learn their mother tongue. For the lowest 10% or so, students develop literacy skills only in English, with oral proficiency offered in the mother tongue. As Lee Kuan Yew explains:<br><br>
Except for the top 8%, a wide vocabulary and high language manipulative skills cannot be the primary aim of L2 [“mother tongue”]…. With English as our working language, for the average student, emphasis on Chinese diction, idiom and style will be too much for them to cope with (Goh 1979, p. v).<br><br>
In this view of education, some students are stronger, while others are weaker, at learning in general; only the stronger students can handle a high level of language proficiency and literacy in two languages.<br><br>
4.6 Maintaining the ethnic language will protect ethnic identity, a sense of “rootedness” and cultural values<br><br>
The goal of Singapore’s bilingual education policy is not in fact to create a general populace who are bilingual and biliterate at a high level; this privilege is reserved for only the best students. With the emphasis on English, what, then, is the purpose of studying a second language, the mother tongue? In discussing Chinese language education, Lee Kuan Yew writes:<br><br>
The greatest value in the teaching and learning of Chinese is in the transmission of the norms of social or moral behaviour. . . .<br><br>
It would be a tragedy if we were to miss this and concentrate on second language proficiency nearly equal to the first language. Malay children should know their proverbs and their folklore…. For the Indians, the Ramayana and the Mahabaratha provide marvellous and inexhaustible sources of stories…. That they also carry a moral message is the genius of the culture. No child should leave school after 9 years without having the “soft-ware” of his culture programmed into his subconscious (Goh 1979, p. v).<br><br>
Early on, English was seen as the language of science and technology, while the mother tongues were designated the transmitters of cultural values and norms. However, the government has not apparently tried to judge the success of passing on traditional values through the mother tongues. The success of the “Speak Mandarin” campaign is measured by the shift of language use at home, work, and in everyday transactions to Mandarin, not the maintenance of Chinese cultural values (Newman, 1988; Riney, 1998). In fact, it has been claimed that although Indians have undergone the greatest language shift to English, they have maintained their traditional values more than Chinese (Riney, 1998). If this is the case, factors other than language must be responsible for the maintenance or loss of traditional values.

	<b><a name="T5">5. Second language acquisition assumption #1: beginning a second language early leads to higher proficiency</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
5.1 Critical or sensitive period hypothesis<br><br>
The assumption that beginning a second language early leads to higher proficiency is a commonly-held view. This assumption jumps right into the heart of the critical or sensitive period hypothesis debate among second language acquisition researchers. The critical period hypothesis refers to the view that there is a critical (or sensitive) period for language acquisition, usually set at puberty, after which learners find it difficult if not impossible to acquire a second language at native-like levels of proficiency. One of the commonly-cited pieces of evidence for the critical period hypothesis is Johnson and Newport’s (1989/1995) study of Chinese and Korean adult L2 speakers of English who had arrived in the US at different ages. They found that adults (all with at least 3 years of unbroken residence in the US) who had arrived before puberty performed better on tests of grammaticality judgment than those who had arrived after puberty. However, Birdsong (1992), studying a group of non-native speakers of French, all of whom arrived in France after puberty, found that many of these highly-proficient L2 learners achieved scores within the native range on tests of grammaticality judgment. Birdsong still found an effect of age of arrival, indicating that even after puberty younger learners may have an advantage over older learners in ultimate attainment. In reviewing the relevant literature on the critical period hypothesis, Marinova-Todd, Marshall and Snow (2000) concede that younger learners as a group outperform older learners as a group; however, the existence of highly proficient older learners raises questions about what factors explain the more variable outcomes of older learners rather than confirming a biological advantage for younger learners.<br><br>
Furthermore, both Johnson & Newport and Birdsong examined L2 learners immersed in the target-language environments. What evidence exists concerning the introduction of a second language early to school L2 learners who are studying the L2 in a non-native context? Turnbull, Lapkin, Hart and Swain (1998), comparing early (about age 5-6), middle (about age 10), and late (about age 12) French immersion students in Canada, found that early immersion students seemed to perform better mostly on speaking skills, despite many more hours of French exposure; no significant differences were found in French literacy skills and on a multiple-choice test of listening skills. These Canadian studies suggest that Singapore could still have highly successful English results even if English-medium education were started around age 10 or 12.<br><br>
5.2 Input hypothesis<br><br>
If there is no biologically-determined “critical period” for L2 acquisition, then what accounts for older learners’ often poor outcomes? The “input hypothesis” proposes that the success of L2 acquisition is largely determined by the quality of the L2 input the learner receives; by this theory, younger learners’ more uniform success in L2 acquisition results from the high-quality, contextualized L2 input younger learners experience (Krashen 1982). Proponents of this hypothesis claim that if a teacher provides an older learner with the kind of high-quality, contextualized input that a child more naturally receives, the older learner will similarly show success in L2 acquisition. The focus then shifts from the age of the learner to the teaching methods employed, with input enthusiasts championing “naturalistic” techniques such as Total Physical Response (Asher 1996). Singapore has moved recently from a more traditional teacher- and textbook-based language pedagogy to a more communicative approach to language learning (Cheah, 1999). However, there is no suggestion that this new approach could be used with older students to delay introduction of English while maintaining high levels of achievement.<br><br>
5.3 Transfer hypothesis<br><br>
Although younger learners have generally demonstrated better ultimate attainment in L2 acquisition, older children and adults may learn an L2 more quickly at the initial stages (Marinova-Todd, Marshall and Snow 2000; Turnbull et al. 1998). The transfer hypothesis posits that concepts that are learned through the L1 can transfer easily to the L2 (Cummins 1979); for example, a child who has learned to solve division problems in his or her L1 need only learn the vocabulary in L2 necessary to understand the problem posed, rather than the concept of division itself. In addition, it is proposed that high levels of L1 proficiency aid a learner in achieving high levels of L2 proficiency (Cummins 1981). Singapore does not attempt to build English language development on a foundation of home language skills; rather, the two languages are considered separate subjects that do not help and may even interfere with each other.

	<b><a name="T6">6. Language planning assumptions underlying Singapore’s policy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Implicit in Singapore’s language policy are many assumptions concerning language planning. Perhaps the most striking is the assumption that language can be managed, that government policy can dictate language use. Several of these assumptions are discussed below.<br><br>
6.1 Language is a tool that should be carefully chosen for its utility to the national interest<br><br>
At independence, Singapore could have discarded its colonial language, English; it could have adopted three official languages (one for each major ethnic group) or many more, to reflect the diversity of home languages in use at that time. However, the official languages were not chosen on the basis of national or ethnic pride; instead, they were chosen for pragmatic reasons. English was assumed to be crucial to Singapore’s economic survival; the “mother tongues” were adopted to maintain ethnic identity and traditional values (Lee 2000). The assumption that language is a tool is examined more closely, in light of language planning theory, in the next section.<br><br>
6.2 A “language” is different from a “dialect,” and only standardized languages are appropriate vehicles for education
In Singapore, each ethnic group is assigned an official mother tongue, whether or not this is the language the individual speaks at home. Chinese dialects in particular, as well as non-standard forms of Malay and colloquial varieties of the Indian languages, are not considered to be real “languages” appropriate for classroom use. Since 1917, all Chinese-language instruction in Singapore has been in Mandarin, a standardized language (Ang 1999). The government promotes Mandarin as the appropriate vehicle with which Chinese can pass on their cultural traditions and values. Similarly, classical Tamil, rather than the colloquial variety actually spoken in Singapore, is used in the schools.<br><br>
Interestingly, children’s linguistic resources were largely ignored by this policy. For the Chinese majority, who in the beginning mostly came to school dominant in a Chinese dialect, dialects were seen as an impediment to learning Mandarin Chinese and English (Lee 2000). However, Newman (1988) reports that a proficient Hokkien speaker, drawing on analogies between the two languages, would be able to predict the Mandarin tonal pronunciation of a given word 90% of the time; but this potential advantage in learning Mandarin was dismissed in favor of urging all Chinese to abandon dialects and use Mandarin at home and with other Chinese.<br><br>
6.3 The government should encourage the use of high-status languages<br><br>
Related to the above assumption, the Singapore government actively encourages the use of “Standard” (British) English over a localized variety of English often called “Singlish” as well as Mandarin over Chinese dialects.<br><br>
6.4 Each written language has a standard oral version as well<br><br>
In Singapore, pronunciation and oral usage are also causes for concern from the language planners. “Proper” British pronunciation of English is promoted, as is the use of Mandarin when reading Chinese characters, which could be pronounced in any of the Chinese “dialects.” Additionally, the formal literary register of Tamil is used at school and in the media, while a standardized Malay pronunciation based on Northern Malay is being promoted (Gopinathan et al. 1999).

	<b><a name="T7">7. Language planning theory and assumption #1: language is a tool that should be carefully chosen for its utility to the national interest</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
This assumption follows an essentially instrumentalist view of language, as espoused by Tauli (1968) and others. Instrumentalists view language as a tool or instrument, and believe that languages or features of a certain language can be objectively evaluated to determine which is more efficient for different language functions (Appel and Muysken 1987). By this theory, a government could carefully compare the potential candidate languages and determine which one is best suited for various government goals. Singapore’s officials looked at the major languages in use in Singapore at independence and believed that only English could help Singapore industrialize and modernize its economy (Yip, Eng and Yap 1990).<br><br>
A sociolinguistic theory of language planning, however, argues for the basic equality of all languages and denies that one could be considered better for a certain purpose than another (Appel and Muysken 1987). Sociolinguists see language as a complex human resource, which is tied to social and cultural circumstances and cannot be objectively “evaluated” outside these contexts. In other words, a sociolinguist would disagree that English is better suited for the study of science and technology, though acknowledging that it may at this time be more developed in that direction than another language (Eastman 1983). Sociolinguists stress the importance of examining the whole context for a language C its use in various domains, the social status of the language, and its role in identity formation -- before making any attempts at language planning (Appel and Muysken 1987).<br><br>
The validity of this assumption depends on one’s theoretical viewpoint and cannot be empirically proven.

	<b><a name="T8">8. Conclusions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Singapore case seems to lend credence to both the instrumentalist and sociolinguistic views of language planning. Instrumentalists may champion the success of the Speak Mandarin campaign, which promoted a created standardized language over home dialects despite little evidence of a pre-existing trend in that direction. Chinese were increasingly sending their children to English-medium schools, which might have killed Mandarin in Singapore if the government had not required Mandarin as a school subject and promoted its use outside school. However, sociolinguists can point to the shift to English as an example of a government simply encouraging the existing sociocultural trend. The government waited to institute English-medium education for all until the vast majority of parents had already chosen it.<br><br>
Singapore’s experience does not resolve any of the ongoing debates in the field of L2 acquisition, as it followed a uniform policy and did not experiment with early vs. late introduction of English, differing amounts of English exposure, or diverse pedagogies. It is tantalizing to speculate on whether Singaporean students would demonstrate even better academic results if they all received substantial education in their actual home languages. However, it certainly shows that a nation can successfully implement widespread education through a non-native medium starting at an early age with little home-language development and achieve good academic results. Whether these results are replicable in countries with very different circumstances remains an open question. Singapore began its nationhood with a serious crisis, perhaps leading its people to accept governmental policy more readily, especially as promised stability and economic gains materialized.<br><br>
While Singapore seems to have achieved the major goals it set for language and education policy, the loss of some of the rich linguistic diversity and the shift from multilingualism to bilingualism may have unintended consequences. Pakir (1993) reports that in an interview with Taiwanese journalists in 1989, Lee Kuan Yew
said that if he had had the chance to go back to 1965 or 1970, he would have kept the Chinese primary school, increased the English in it as the second language, and encouraged parents to send their children to the Chinese language school. Then, he would have given an additional year (either at primary or secondary level) to help the average student change from Chinese as First Language learning to English as First Language learning (Pakir 1993, p. 83).<br><br>
This same principle could have been extended to the Malay- and Tamil-medium schools as well. Would there have been a difference in attainment of English? In attainment of mother tongue? In overall educational achievement? In economic success? Or, as Lee believes, in maintenance of traditional values? Would those students who currently perform poorly in English demonstrate better academic results, overall and in English, if they received more schooling through their home language? One cannot turn back the clock to try a different scenario; however, other countries looking to replicate Singapore’s educational and economic success should consider these questions in their own context.<br><br>
Now, Singapore seems on an unalterable course from a diverse multilingualism to a more uniform bilingualism in English and one other official language. As the trend toward English and official languages continues, will Singapore become more of a monolingual English-speaking country, with mother tongues reduced to a school subject only? Will Chinese dialects and Indian vernaculars disappear altogether or enjoy a symbolic revival? Will a shift to English dominance impair the transmission of traditional values to the next generation? The Singapore case will continue to offer fascinating data to language planners, educational policy analysts, and L2 acquisition researchers for decades to come.<br><br>

Many avenues would prove fruitful for future research. An ethnographic study on actual home and community language use would illuminate how much and for what purposes each language is used in Singapore today. A closer examination of the English language and “mother tongue” skills of students in all the different educational tracks would indicate who wins and loses under the current policy and what happens to those students who do not master English. For my own future research, I will look at the English oral-language and preliteracy skills of kindergarten children before they enter Primary One. How much English proficiency do children gain in two years of kindergarten? What home and school factors may contribute to English proficiency in Kindergarten 2 pupils?<br><br>

Racism is rarely far from the surface of Asian societies, and this is especially true
of those multiracial societies that feel the need to promote racial tolerance as part of
official ideology. Yet even in these cases, promoting racial tolerance does not
necessarily imply the promotion of racial indifference. Singapore's multiracialism, for
instance, encourages a high consciousness of one's race even as it insists on tolerance.
Further, it has been considered by many as a covert form of discrimination in favour
of the majority Chinese and against the minorities, especially the Malays. This article
is an attempt to advance our understanding of Singapore's idiosyncratic version of
multiracialism by casting new light on the thinking of its primary architect, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>
Despite official denials there can be little doubt that there is an unofficial
pro-Chinese bias in Singapore, and that in spite of the structures of "meritocracy" and
sometimes because of them, the Malay minority in particular has suffered structural
discrimination. Even a cursory survey of recent history confirms this impression. For
two decades after separation from Malaysia in 1965, for instance, the Singapore
government had an unofficial policy of excluding Malays from the Singapore Armed
Forces and the police force because of concerns about their loyalty. Not only did this
practice deny Malays a traditional source of employment, but it made other employers
reluctant to hire them because they were, technically, still eligible to be called up. (1)<br><br>
At the same time, the government exaggerated, possibly unintentionally, the structural
impediments to Malays' educational advancement. At the time of separation from
Malaysia, Malay students in Singapore had already been disadvantaged inadvertently
because they were streamed through Malay-language schools which were staffed by
under-qualified teachers, and which used substandard Malay-language text books. (2)<br><br>
These schools had very high attrition and failure rates from the beginning, but after
separation even the successful students faced unique linguistic and academic hurdles
in their pursuit of higher education. After separation, not only did the Malays find that
their language had little economic value, but they discovered that their schools had
not prepared them for tertiary education in the new Singapore. The first problem was
that unlike Chinese-educated Chinese attending Nanyang University, and
English-speaking Chinese, Indians and Eurasians attending the University of
Singapore, the Malays had no tertiary institutions in which they did not face a
language barrier. In fact Malay students' command of English was so poor that they alone were required to take an oral examination as part of their entry requirements to
university. Further, as part of the push for national and economic survival in
newly-independent Singapore, university scholarships were restricted to those
students pursuing technical and science disciplines, and the inadequately staffed and
poorly resourced Malay-stream schools had left their students singularly ill-equipped
to qualify or compete for these scholarships. (3) The Malay's problem was
compounded by their continuing socio-economic marginalisation, (4) and by the
near-universal perception that their underachievement reflected their racial and
cultural defects: that they had grown up in the "soft," lethargic Malay Culture which
did not encourage studiousness, enterprise or hard work. Between their educational
and employment disadvantages, and the psychological impact of being told that their
problems were the result of their ethnic culture, it is not surprising that Malays are
still at an economic disadvantage today.<br><br>
Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the saga of Singapore's Malays, however, is
not the actual discrimination, but the fact that Singapore's multiracial meritocracy has
provided the rationale for its justification, and that this rationale has been effective to
the point that even Malay teachers have come to accept this "cultural deficit"
explanation of Malay underachievement. (5) The perception of the cultural deficiency
of the Malays is, to some extent, a continuation of the prejudices fostered by the
British colonial authorities who regarded the Malays as slow and lazy because they
preferred their agrarian kampong lifestyle to working in tin mines for money. (6) This
interpretation, however, ignores the role of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in
moulding the ideological and social perceptions of Singaporeans. Although no
nation's history can ever be reduced to the story of one man, Lee Kuan Yew had such
a paramount role in making modem Singapore that an understanding of that society
cannot be complete without an attempt at understanding Lee himself. The remainder
of this article is devoted to contributing to our understanding of Lee's views on race.

	<b><a name="T11">Lee Kuan Yew's Story</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Understanding any aspect of Lee Kuan Yew's career requires a syncretic
approach. but fully understanding his racial views stretches holistic analysis to new
limits. Lee's views on race have been a matter of much private, but little published
comment. This now changes with the publication of his authorised biography, Lee
Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas, (7) in which Lee speaks about race with
unprecedented candour. Upon close inspection, Lee's racial beliefs prove not to be an
aberration or idiosyncrasy in his thinking, but the consummation of his world view
and his political thought.<br><br>
Until the late 1990s, Lee rarely allowed his public record to be sullied by any
explicit statement that could be construed as racist, though on occasions he has come
close to doing so. He has, for instance, argued that there are links between economic
performance and race. In 1993, Lee wrote an article for The Economist in which he
speculated on the state of the world in the twenty-first century, with special emphasis
on Asia. (8) Lee put his own views into the mouth of a fictional Chinese Singaporean,
Wang Chang, who then discussed his views with his friend, Ali Alkaff. Lee painted a

picture of a prosperous twenty-first century East Asian industrial belt consisting of
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and coastal China, while South and South East
Asia (except for Singapore) languished by comparison. Singapore, although
geographically part Of South East Asia, was economically on a par with the more
prosperous East Asian region. (9) In the subsequent "discussion" of these predictions,
"Wang Chang" made it clear that race was a factor in his assessment, since he based
his forecasting "on a people's culture, heredity and organisational strengths." (10)<br><br> A
few years earlier, Lee used his 1989 National Day Rally address to defend the
Government's programme of encouraging Chinese immigration from Hong Kong on
the basis that the birth rate of Singapore's Chinese is lower than that of the Indians
and Malays. The numerical preponderance of the Chinese must be maintained, said
Lee, "or there will be a shift in the economy, both the economic performance and the
political backdrop which makes that economic performance possible." (11) <br><br>Lee
enumerated several reasons why maintaining the Chinese proportion of the population
at current levels was necessary for economic prosperity - including the "culture" and
"nature" of the Chinese. Without a hint of irony, Lee also took the opportunity to
assure Malays that they need not fear Hong Kong immigrants taking their jobs
because the immigrants will all be high income earners. <br><br>In 1977 Lee treated
Parliament to a four hour post-election victory speech which could best be described
as "uninhibited." In this speech, Lee told the multi-racial chamber, "I understand the
Englishman. He knows deep in his heart that he is superior to the Welshman and the
Scotsman.... Deep here, I am a Chinaman." (12) In recent times, Lee has not only
been more forthright about his racial views but he has also confirmed that he held
them at least as early as the beginning of the 1970s. In October 1989, in an interview
with Malaysia's New Straits Times Lee revealed that after he read Mahathir
Mohamad's The Malay, Dilemma (13) in 1971 in 1971 or 1972, he found himself "in
agreement with three-quarters of his analysis of the problem" of the economic and
educational under-performance of the Malays. (14) According to Lee and Mahathir,
the problem was both cultural and genetic. (15) Lee noted with approval that
Mahathir's views were the "result of his medical training, and... he was not likely to
change them." (16)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Indiscretion 不慎重的行为</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
While Lee has been moderately circumspect in most of his public statements on
race, there have been rare occasions on which he has shown less discretion than usual.<br><br>
The earliest such documented occasion was on 27 December 1967, when Lee
addressed a meeting at the University of Singapore. (17) After his speech there was a
question and answer session, in which a question was asked about "the most
important factor, the X-factor, in development." (18) Two members of the audience
have given the author independent and almost identical accounts of Lee's answer.
According to Chandra Muzaffar, Lee responded in these terms:<br><br>
"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in the same
condition and each needing a blood transfusion. The first, a Southeast Asian was
given the transfusion but died a few hours later. The second, a South Asian was also

given a transfusion but died a few days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a
transfusion and survived. That is the X factor in development." (19)<br><br>
Herman Paul independently gave the following account of Lee's answer: "There
were 3 women, one of them from East Asia, another from South Asia and the 3rd from
S-E Asia. They were admitted to the Singapore General Hospital. Their condition was
precarious, and they all received blood transfusions. The woman from S-E Asia
passed away. The woman from East Asia survived. The woman from South-East Asia
(20) passed away. " (21)<br><br>
Each listener took the Southeast Asian to be a Malay or perhaps a member of one
of the aboriginal races of the region. Each of them took the South Asian woman to be
an Indian, and the East Asian who survived was Chinese, or perhaps Japanese or
Korean. Lee revealed in this speech, as reported by Chandra Muzaffar a perception of
a racial hierarchy of Asians, in which the Chinese and other East Asians are at the top,
Malays and other Southeast Asians are at the bottom, and Indians and other South
Asians are in between. On this occasion Lee made no attempt to disguise his views on
race with discussion of related factors, such as culture. He was talking about the
inherent, genetic, strength and weakness of the different races. The emphasis that Lee
has placed on culture and race in economic development has varied over the years.<br><br>
Only 27 months after Lee argued that race is the "X-factor" in development, Lee
credited "ethnic factors" with being one of the variables in economic development,
though on this occasion he contradicted his December 1967 statement by arguing that
these "ethnic factors" were a minor consideration compared to "cultural factors." (22)
Regardless of the balance between the two factors in Lee's thinking, there is no room
to doubt that both race and culture play related if different roles in Lee's political
thought.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T13">Hierarchy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The hierarchy of races revealed in Lee's December 1967 parable helps to explain
a similar hierarchy of humiliation to which Lee referred four years earlier, when he
said, "Humiliation and degradation by foreign European powers is bad enough. It was
worse at the hands of a conquering Asian nation like Japan - and it will be even worse
if it should be by a neighbouring power in South-East Asia." (23) In fact, Lee's racial
hierarchy is much more complex than he indicated on either of these occasions. In
1982 he revealed his belief that Jews share with East Asians a place at the top of the
racial pyramid. and that both occupy a higher place than Americans:<br><br>
"Let us not deceive ourselves: our talent profile is nowhere near that of, say, the
Jews or the Japanese in America. The exceptional number of Nobel Prize winners
who are Jews is no accident. It is also no accident that a high percentage, sometimes
50%, of faculty members in the top American universities on both the east and west
coasts are Jews. And the number of high calibre Japanese academics, professionals,
and business executives is out of all proportion to the percentage of Japanese in the
total American population." (24)<br><br>
More recently, commenting upon Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein's The
Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, (25) Lee told his authorised biographers:
"The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score 85 per cent on IQ
and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites score on average 100. Asians
score more... the Bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities
that, if you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money
on wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow." (26)<br><br>
A reading of the evidence cited above suggests that Lee has always had an
agenda based on the racial and cultural superiority of Singapore's Chinese population.<br><br>
If this analysis is accurate, however, it requires a complementary argument which
accounts adequately for the fact that Lee did not begin acting on these beliefs until the
late 1970s. On the surface, such a line of argument appears plausible, since there are
no shortage of external factors which could have restrained Lee's sinocentric bias until
the early 1980s. His early hostility to Chinese education, culture and language, for
instance, can be explained by the fact that Lee regarded Chinese culture as a threat to
Singapore's stability because it was so closely associated with Chinese chauvinism,
Chinese communism and loyalty to the People's Republic of China. (27) As well as
these internal communal factors, it is known that Lee considered that allowing even
the appearance of creating a sinocentric culture in the 1960s or 1970s would have
heightened tensions between Singapore and its Malay neighbours. (28) These were
sufficient reasons for Lee to continue his campaign of gutting Chinese education and
building a communally neutral multiracialism. By 1979, however, Singapore's
political and regional landscape had been totally transformed. Chinese culture was
succumbing to the constant incursion of English language education and Western
influence through the media. Nanyang University, almost the last institutional bastion
of Chinese culture and Chinese communism. was demoralised, (29) and the
Chinese-educated were on the verge of becoming a minority in the electorate. (30)<br><br>
This meant that Chinese culture was no longer seen as a major threat to Singapore's
internal stability. Furthermore, Singapore's relations with both Malaysia and Indonesia
had reached a new high thanks to the spirit of regional solidarity within ASEAN,
prompted by the fall of Vietnam in 1975. (31) The post-separation siege mentality
towards the Malay world was now redundant, if it had ever been valid. This
development coincided roughly with the retirement, enforced or otherwise, of most of
the "old -guard" of PAP leaders. By the mid-1980s Lee had surrounded himself with
younger second generation leaders Substantially dependent upon his patronage, thus
relieving Lee of another constraint. The sinicization of Singapore was now a political
possibility for Lee, and according to the logic of this argument, he then took the
opportunity to act on his racial beliefs.<br><br>
While this thesis goes some way towards explaining Lee's actions, it faces
serious problems. It is important. for instance, to acknowledge that not only did Lee
show no signs of acting on Chinese racial or cultural supremacist beliefs until the very
end of the 1970s, but for many of those years he was widely demonised as an enemy
of Chinese culture. Alex Josey wrote in1974 that "within ten or fifteen years, Lee
Kuan Yew expects the Chinese language to be unimportant, " (32) and this seemed a
fair assessment. The majority of Chinese parents were choosing English as the first language for their children’s education since English was the language which led to
good jobs and upward social mobility. (33)<br><br> Nanyang University was struggling to
survive and was under a continuing cloud of suspicion that it was fostering Chinese
chauvinism and communism. This suspicion had lead the Government to "disperse"
former communist Chinese-educated students to universities in Australia, Canada and
New Zealand, rather than allow them to study at Nanyang. (34) In 1971 two Chinese
language newspapers, Sin Chew Jit Poh and Nanyang Siang Pau were brought to heel
for allegedly promoting Chinese chauvinism and accusing the government of killing
Chinese education and the Chinese language.(35)<br><br>
These factors by themselves undermine the thesis that Lee was always a closet
Chinese Supremacist. Consideration must be given also to the testimony of Lee's
close associates from those early decades, who flatly contradict the picture of Lee
Kuan Yew as a Chinese cultural or racial supremacist. Goh Keng Swee was Lee's
right hand man for twenty years in government, at one stage rising to the position of
First Deputy Prime Minister. When Goh was shown Chandra Muzaffar's account of
Lee's December 1967 parable, he was genuinely shocked and lost for words. Finally
he stammered. "I can't imagine he spoke in such crude terms." (36)<br><br>
E.W. Barker, a Minister in Lee's Cabinet for more than twenty years and his
friend for more than two decades before that, was equally adamant in interview that
"there was nothing of this race business in Cabinet. I wouldn't have served if it was a
pro-Chinese government, but it was not." (37) While Lee believed in his heart that the
Chinese were genetically and culturally superior, he separated this belief from his
public policy. Only in the late 1970s did his racial beliefs begin to exert a noticeable
influence upon public policy. The discrepancy between the picture of the Chinese,
racial and cultural supremacist which we are able to paint from a collage of' Lee's
words is barely reconcilable with Lee's public record up to the late 1970s and with the
accounts given by his close associates of forty and fifty years. It is obvious that the
thesis that Lee was restrained from acting on his beliefs by external forces is
insufficient. As is the case with most aspects of Lee's career, the story is much more
complicated, and requires a detailed study of the gradual development of his political
thought.

	<b><a name="T14">Origins</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
At this stage it is important to consider the origins of Lee's racial views. It is
natural to assume that Lee's beliefs stem directly from prejudices he learnt as a child.<br><br>
While there is a certain likelihood in this line of approach, Lee's own accounts suggest
that he arrived at his racial views as a result of observation, empirical enquiry and
study as an adult: "I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's the
most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed over
evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth, been isolated from each
other, developed independently had different intermixtures between races, peoples,
climates, soils. ...I didn't start off with that knowledge. But by observation, reading,
watching, arguing, asking, that is the conclusion I've come to." (38)<br><br>
Lee maintains that at some stage before the late 1960s he had acted under the assumption that all races were equal, but bitter disappointment convinced him that the
reality was otherwise: "When we were faced with the reality that, in fact, equal
opportunities did not bring about more equal results, we were faced with [an]
ideological dilemma. ... In other words, this Bell curve, which Murray and Herrnstein
wrote about, became obvious to us by the late '60s." (39)<br><br>
The evolution of Lee's racism was a long process. According to Lee himself he
began to form his views on race while he was a student in London. (40) He has
described how his ideas firmed in 1956 on a visit to Europe and London, (41) and
then reached their full force in the Malaysia period. (42) The details and implications
of Lee's account of the development of his racial views are considered later in this
article, but one must be sceptical that his adult mind was ever a tabula rasa on the
question of race. Lee likes to consider himself a pure empiricist who can rise above
preconceptions and prejudices, but it seems reasonable to assume that the very
questions he asked as an adult, and his early fascination with questions of race sprang
from an existing, possibly unconscious world view in which race was an all-pervasive
feature.<br><br>
In racially conscious Singapore it would have been difficult to have grown up
without exposure to racial stereotyping. Further, the Chinese of Lee's parents' and
grandparents' generations grew up in a culture which emphasised familial piety and
ancestor worship and who were naturally proud of both their ancestry and their
tenuous association with the glories of Chinese civilisation. Ethnic pride can slip
easily into racial prejudice in the most racially unconscious society, and Singapore
was and is anything but racially unconscious. We might believe Lee when he
maintains that he had, at some stage in his early adult life, come to the intellectual
conviction that all races are equal. His childhood, however, was steeped in racial
stereotyping that meant that questions of race were never far from the surface of his
dynamically inquisitive mind, and deep seated stereotypes were always ready to
challenge race-blind explanations of the world. <br><br>Hence, when he visited other
countries, even as a student, he took his racial consciousness with him. He has told his
biographers, "I visited Europe during my vacation (as a student) and then saw India,
Pakistan, Ceylon, Indonesia, Japan, Germany ... You look for societies which had
been more successful and you ask yourself why." (43) Note Lee's assumption that a
society's "success" can be judged by a universal standard of progress and
development.<br><br>
For Lee it was natural to judge peoples according to the how high up the ladder
of progress they had climbed, and his background made him prone to place people in
racial and cultural categories when making such judgements.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">Rationale</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Lee may have brought the kernel of his racial prejudices intact from childhood,
but as an adult he has woven an intricate argument to rationalise and develop his view.<br><br>
His argument rests on four pillars: an environmental determinism based upon a
distortion of Arnold Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" thesis; a medieval scientism
which gives an important role to ductless glands in determining a person's and a

people's drive to achieve; a Lamarckian view of evolution; and a belief in
culturally-based eugenics and dysgenics. The influence of Arnold Toynbee on Lee
since the mid-1960s is well documented in speeches and inter-views. <br><br>From 1967
onwards Lee acknowledged Toynbee as a source of his ideas. (44) It is less
well-known that Lee began quoting Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" thesis in
Cabinet meetings as soon as the PAP came to power in 1959, (45) and that Toynbee
was widely read and vigorously discussed in Lee's circle of friends at Cambridge
University. (46) The connection between Toynbee's thesis and Lee Kuan Yew's racial
beliefs is convoluted, but it is the lynch pin of Lee's rationalisation of his Chinese
racial suprematism.<br><br>

Central to the thesis propounded by Toynbee in A Study of History, was the
notion that societies and civilisations develop in response to certain challenges.<br><br>
Toynbee argued that "civilizations come to birth in environments that are unusually
difficult and not unusually easy." (47) The Sinic Civilisation, wrote Toynbee, was
nurtured in the north of China, where the climate was severe, and swamps and regular
floods made agriculture difficult, and so it became a "hard" society. (48) Conversely,
societies that were nurtured in easy environments, without challenges from people or
nature are inherently weak. in Volume I of Study, Toynbee repeated a parable
originally told by Ellsworth Huntington in his Civilisation and Climate. <br><br>It was the
story of a group of savages from the tropics who travelled north into the colder
climate. Upon the onset of the first winter, some returned to the tropics, "resumed the
old life and their descendants are untutored Savages to this day." (49)<br><br>
All of the others perished except for one group which invented clothes,
constructed shelter, learned to dry meat and store it, and discovered how to make fire.
"And in the process of adjusting themselves to a hard environment they advanced by
enormous strides, leaving the tropical part of Mankind in the rear." (50) <br><br>No one
should suggest that Lee, Toynbee or Huntington believed that this parable was
literally true. The story does demonstrate, however, Toynbee's lesson of the
importance of the challenge of climate and more generally, of the environment,
whereby those people whose civilisations grew in the "soft" life of the tropics were
left behind by their hardier cousins in harsher climates. Lee has taken Toynbee's
arguments and used them to justify a dismissive attitude towards the Malayan and
Indian Cultures. This logic explains the hierarchy of hardiness of the three women in
Lee's parable. The Southeast Asian died first because she came from an easy tropical
climate. The South Asian lived a little longer because the climate of the Subcontinent
is less amenable than that of tropical Southeast Asia. The East Asian lived because she
- or at least her ancestors - came from a very harsh climate which brought out tougher
qualities in her people. With a harsh climate go many challenges which develop a
plethora of cultural and racial characteristics in a people.<br><br>
In 1965, in an interview on Australian television, Lee discussed the differences
between the Malays and the Chinese in Malaysia: "One is the product of a civilisation
which has gone through all its ups and downs, of floods and famine and pestilence,

breeding a people with very intense culture, with a belief in high performance in
sustained effort, in thrift and industry. And the other people. more fortunately
endowed by nature, with warm sunshine and bananas and coconuts, and therefore not
with the same need to strive so hard. Now, these two societies really move at two
different speeds. It's like the difference between a high- revolution engine and a
low-revolution engine. I'm not saying that one is better or less good than the other.<br><br>
But I'm just stating a fact that one was the product of another environment another
history, another civilisation, and the other is a product of another different climate,
different history." (51)<br><br>
Lee found an unwitting ally for his views on cultural suprematism in the
Scandinavian social scientist, Gunnar Myrdal. The connection was made by Lee
himself in his 1971 commemorative lecture at his old college at Cambridge University,
in which he argued this case at length: "It is in part the difference between the more
intense and exacting Sinic cultures of East Asia and the less demanding values of
Hindu culture of South and South-east Asia, that accounts for the difference in
industrial progress between Eastern and Southern Asia. The softer and more benign
Hindu civilisation spread through Burma, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, meeting the
Sinic civilisation on the borders of Vietnam....<br><br>
Gunnar Myrdal, in his "Asian Drama" (52) voluminously sets out the reasons for
lower achievements amongst these peoples [of South and South-cast Asia]. He terms
them "soft societies." Their expectations and desire for achievement are lower. Had he
studied the Sinic civilisations of East Asia - Korea, Japan, China and Vietnam - he
would have come to the opposite conclusions, that these were hard societies. (53)<br><br>
While references to Gunnar Myrdal began only after the publication of Myrdal's
Asian Drama in 1968, Lee had expressed similar views long before this. In 1965, at
the height of both Indonesia's Confrontation with Malaysia, and Singapore's
difficulties with Kuala Lumpur, Lee made a revealing speech in which he dismissed
the threat from Indonesia because of the soft and indulgent nature of its culture,
though at this stage the term "soft culture" was not part of Lee's vocabulary: "...these
were not cultures which created societies capable of intense discipline, concentrated
effort over sustained periods. Climate, the effects of relatively abundant society and
the tropical conditions produced a people largely extrovert, easy-going and leisurely.<br><br>
They've got their wars, they have their periods of greatness when the Hindus came in
the 7th and again in the l2th centuries in the Majapahit and the Srivijaya empires. But
in between the ruins of Borobudur and what you have of Indonesia today, you see a
people primarily self-indulgent." (54) These are merely two examples of Lee's many
Myrdalian statements which express a condescending attitude towards the indigenous
cultures of South and Southeast Asia.<br><br>
Early in 1967, Lee expounded his views on the stultifying effects of living in the
tropics, and explained why Singapore is the exception to the rule: "There is only one
other civilization near the Equator that ever produced anything worthy of its name.<br><br>
That was the Yucatan peninsular of South America - the Mayan Civilization. There is
no other place where human beings were able to surmount the problems of a soporific
equatorial climate. You can go along the Equator or 2 degrees north of it, and they all

sleep after half past two if they have had a good meal. They do! Otherwise they must
die earlier. It is only in Singapore that they don't. And there were good reasons for this.<br><br>
First, good glands, and second, good purpose." (55)<br><br>
There are three noteworthy points in this excerpt, apart from the confirmation of
Lee's environmental determinism. First, the reference to the Mayan Civilisation is
almost certainly derived directly from Arnold Toynbee's Study. (56) <br><br>Second, Lee has
either overlooked or dismissed the former greatness of the Javanese Culture, since
acknowledging it would have qualified his theory of environmental determinism.<br><br>
Third, this quotation introduces Lee's idiosyncratic ideas about the role of glands, and
allows Lee to take a deft step from justification by culture to justification by
physiology and thus genetics.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
According to Lee, ductless glands, especially the adrenal gland, play a crucial
role in determining the drive of people, both as individuals and as races. In 1966, Lee
told the Socialist International: "There are believed to be two influences on the
efficacy of human resources. First, biological, and second cultural factors.<br><br>
Anthropologists all emphasize the cultural influence as the factor which causes
variations in capacity between men, tribes and nations but they do not discount
altogether the possibility of biological differences between man and man because of
differences in their ductless glands. I would have certain reservations about attributing
all differences completely to cultural factors for I remember the Australian aborigines,
who, in spite of considerable exposure to a new, society they were suddenly
confronted with, have yet been unable to adjust and to emerge as an equal in his new
environment. As against that. we have the negroes in Africa transported into slavery in
America who have emerged as scientists, doctors, lawyers, boxers, high jumpers,
runners and so on." (57)<br><br>
Leaving aside the question of Lee's ignorance of Australian Aborigines and
Afro-Americans, this speech demonstrated that Lee perceived that there was a direct
link between ductless glands, the drive to achieve, and race. In 1971, Lee explicitly
linked his views on ductless glands to Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" thesis,
and erroneously attributed his own ideas to Toynbee.<br><br>
Describing the challenge of planning a reserve army after Singapore's separation
from Malaysia, Lee said, "Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" summed up our
position. If we did not have it in us, enough output from the adrenal and other ductless
glands, we would have fallen flat on our faces." (58) The author's research has failed
to uncover any reference in Study which could justify Lee's attribution of his views on
glands to Toynbee, which is not surprising since, despite the impression created by
Lee, Toynbee devoted sixty four pages of Study to arguing that race is not a factor in
determining a civilisation's rate of development. (59) Lee, however, has taken
Toynbee's views on the role of the environment. and developed a view of race based
on a much stricter theory of environmental determinism than was ever advocated by
Toynbee.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T18">Lamarck</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The connection in Lee's mind between race and the development of the ductless
glands is based upon his adherence to his personal Lamarckian theory of evolution,
according to which acquired characteristics can be inherited. Hence, "hard" and "soft"
countries not only produce "hard" and "soft" cultures, but their people acquire "hard"
and "soft" physiological characteristics. This explains why in Lee's parable of
December 1967, the woman from the "hard" East Asian society lived after her
operation, while the women from the "soft" South Asian and Southeast Asian societies
died. The evidence for believing that Lee holds a Lamarckian view of evolution is
found most overtly in a series of speeches In the 1960s. These speeches express his
admiration for the energy and drive displayed by those of "migrant stock," who have
inherited their "good glands" from their parents, and his peculiar notion of
acclimatisation as genetically passed down through generations. The speeches also
reveal a fear that he and the ethnic Chinese of Singapore will lose the drive which has
made them successful, not only because they have left the "hard environment" of their
forebears and are now living in the tropics, but because they are also living in a more
prosperous, but "softer" and thus inferior culture. (60)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">Migrant Stock</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Lee developed, or at least rationalised, his Lamarckian theories during his two
month tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1965, though his thoughts had been
turned in this direction for some time. Soon after his return from the tour, Lee gave a
lecture to public servants at the Political Study Centre. There he told his audience that
he began his tour grappling with the problems of large scale migration. He was
fascinated by the similarities between Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, in so far
as they are all new communities built by migrants from nothing. (61) <br><br>Throughout the
tour, Lee's preconceived but unclear ideas were confirmed and he became
increasingly convinced that the similarities between Australia, New Zealand and
Singapore were of major significance in that each of them were migrant communities
which were evolving further away from their original stock." (62)<br><br> Lee opined that the
tough migrant cultures of Australia, New Zealand and Singapore had produced
societies with "a tremendous amount of enterprise" which he characterised as a
"frontier spirit." (63) The problem in Lee's mind, however, was that as prosperity
comes to a migrant people, life becomes easier, the culture becomes softer, and the
genes "go down":<br><br>
"We are not unlike the other migrant groups in the South Pacific. We share a lot
of their characteristics. We share a lot of their problems. And one of these problems is
to secure what we have created for prosperity. Which means, you and me, the genes
going down. ...You have come with certain equipment. Your cultural values, your
habit patterns, your techniques, the drive, the push, the thrust, to conquer nature and
make a life. But in the process you become a different people." (64)<br><br>
Migrants and their descendants, it appears, have tremendous reserves of stamina
and determination, but they are constantly faced with the challenge of maintaining
their genetic inheritance because they are now living in a culture and an environment

different from the one in which their ancestors developed their good genes. Less than
a week later, Lee resumed his theme with a slightly different twist at an Institute of
Engineers' dinner after his hostess unwisely told him that she was thinking of
migrating to Australia or New Zealand: I was spending the whole evening advising
my hostess what a ghastly error it is for people to migrate... I told her of my
experience. Three generations here, and I haven't got a climate I am used to yet." (65)<br><br>
Lee believes that he is acclimatised to northern China because that was the ancestral
home of the paternal line of his ancestors. For some reason, possibly related to the
patrilineal nature of Chinese culture, Lee chooses to ignore the ancestors of his
mother, who is generally thought to have been part-Malay. (66) He seems also to have
forgotten the difficulty he had in coping with the cold of England while he was a
student at Cambridge University. (67) It is tempting to discount Lee's words as an
aberration, especially when taken in the context of the rest of this undisciplined
speech, some of which is quoted later in this article. It is now known that earlier in the
day, Lee sent a secret letter to the Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, in
which he expressed deep pessimism for the future of Malaysia, and pleaded with
Menzies to speak to Tunku Abdul Rahman on Singapore's behalf. (68) <br><br>There can be
little doubt that the mood of despair expressed in the letter continued Into the evening,
and was deepened when his hostess rather insensitively sought his advice about
emigrating. It may have been Lee's black mood that prompted him to speak wildly on
this occasion, but there can be little doubt that he was nevertheless conveying his true
thoughts, since he presented the same argument in an interview with Gerald Stone
seven years later: Lee: I'm extremely sensitive to changes in temperature, humidity,
mainly because I think after four generations here I'm still not acclimatised.<br><br>
Stone: You came from Northern China?<br><br>
Lee: Mid-China, but the climate doesn't suit me. (69)<br><br>
While Lee regularly complains about Singapore's stifling humidity, he wears his
discomfort like a badge of honour. He believes that he does not belong in the tropics,
but was "stranded" there by his great-grandfather one hundred years before he was
born. (70) "My great grandfather came here with nothing," Lee told an audience in
1967. "He made something and decided to get out while the going was good! My
tragedy started when he left his son behind ... and here I am." (71) <br><br>In Lee's mind,
finding the humidity uncomfortable is a sign that he still has the "good genes" and the
"good glands" of his ancestors. The Chinese of Southeast Asia have yet another
reason to be proud of their genes, because not only are they mostly Chinese, but they
are of "migrant stock" which by its nature is more hardy and enterprising than the
genes of those who accepted the world as it was and stayed at home:<br><br>
"We came here into the mud flat, and built this out of the marshes. And I felt
what they felt that if anybody feels they can come over in a canoe and take it over,
then I say, over my dead body... That, I think, is at least one of the qualities of the
migrant. He carries with him some of the qualities of the desperate circumstances
which impelled his forefathers to leave their more comfortable societies and pit their
luck and kill against unknown odds." (72) Two years later, Lee proudly proclaimed
that "very few such cities on the equator the climate and the stupor, the heat and the

humidity notwithstanding - have the cultural verve and dynamism of a migrant
community which have made this place throb with life and vitality." (73) It is just as
well that migrants' genes are hardier than average, because in other ways they are of a
lower standard than those of their racial confreres, since they are descended from
"peasant stock." (74) If he and other Chinese Singaporeans can maintain their genetic
and glandular standards, it is good news for Singapore, but it is a constant battle
against the climate and the environment. As Lee explained to a group of trade
unionists in Adelaide: "The Chinaman who came out to Southeast Asia was a very
hard working, thrifty person. I mean he faced a tremendous stride [sic] because he
faced floods, pestilence, famine..., [but] we are getting soft. You know, all sunshine
and bananas growing on trees and coconuts falling down by themselves - this affects
people. To a certain extent, you can try and counter it.... Up to a point we can strive to
lessen the burden.... This is a problem all migrants face. You are part of one culture,
one civilization and culture. But it is a different climate." (75)<br><br>
In fact climate is only one of the factors against which the Chinese had to battle
in coming to Southeast Asia. They were also coping with the debilitating effect of
moving from a superior to an inferior civilisation. At the Institute of Engineers' dinner
in April 1965, Lee continued his dissertation on the problems of migrating to Australia
or New Zealand: "I told my hostess that where I think it is a ghastly error all this large
movements of human beings seeking a better life is that one has got to be quite sure
that in the end [one] is going to offer a higher civilization. Otherwise, you end up just
eating more beef steak and pork chops and mutton chops and what happens when
people cease to want to buy your dairy produce and leave you stranded in the South
Pacific as I am stranded in Southeast Asia. ...I advised her against settling in Australia
and New Zealand because I am quite sure that her progeny will regret all this because
they were unlikely to create a civilization vaster and greater than the one they left
behind. I say, before you leave behind all these things just make sure you are going to
create something better. And if you are not going to, then perhaps it shouldn't be done
because this is the way I thought about my great grandfather leaving me here." (76)<br><br>
Lee argued that the debilitating effects of climate and moving to an inferior
civilisation were too great to resist in the long term, (77) although measures could be
taken to slow down their effects.

	<b><a name="T20">Cultural Eugenics</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The last plank of Lee's racial logic is his view of cultural eugenics and dysgenics.
Lee believes that some cultures have social customs which are naturally eugenic while
others are burdened with dysgenic sexual mores. He believes, for instance, that the
Catholic Church suffers from a dysgenic culture: "All the bright young men became
Catholic priests and did not marry. Bright priests, celibate, produce no children. And
the result of several generations of bright Fathers producing no children? Less bright
children in the Catholic world." (78)<br><br>
Of more practical relevance to the development of Lee's politic I thought is his
view that the genetic quality of the Malays is low because of their dysgenic Culture.<br><br>
In 1989 Lee confirmed his general agreement with Mahathir Mohamad's The Malay

Dilemma, which argued in part: "Malays abhor the state of celibacy. To remain
unmarried was and is considered shameful. Everyone must be married at some time or
other. The result is that whether a person is fit or unfit for marriage, he or she still
marries and reproduces. An idiot or a simpleton is often married off to an old widower,
ostensibly to take care of him in his old age. If this is not possible, backward relatives
are paired off in marriage. These people survive, reproduce and propagate their
species. The cumulative effect of this can be left to the imagination." (79)<br><br>
Of these and other arguments which purportedly account for the supposed
backwardness of Malays, Lee said: "From that book I realised that [Dr Mahathir]
believed in it as a medical man - that these were problems of the development of the
Malay race, Anthropological problems, and these were strongly-held views. Indeed, I
found myself in agreement with three-quarters of his analysis of the problem - that the
Malays had always withdrawn from competition and never really entered into the
mainstream of economic activity; that the Malays would always get their children or
relatives married off regardless of whether it was good or bad." (80)<br><br>
The Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, are among an elite of races which have a
thoroughly eugenic culture: "From the 10th to 11th century inEurope, in Ashkenazim,
the practice developed of the rabbi becoming the most desirable son-in-law because
he is usually the brightest of the flock. ... So he becomes the richest and wealthiest.
He marries young, is successful, probably bright. He has large numbers of children
and the brightest of the children will become the rabbi and so it goes on." (81)<br><br>
The Chinese also have benefited from centuries of practising cultural eugenics,
though his logic works only if you assume that a person's economic status directly
reflects his or her-intelligence and energy: "In the older generations, economies and
culture settled it. The pattern of procreation was settled by economics and culture. The
richer you are, the more successful you are, the more wives you have, the more
children you have. That's the way it was settled. I am the son of a successful chap. I
myself am successful, so I marry young and I marry more wives and I have more
children. You read Hong Lou Meng, A Dream of the Red Chamber, or you read Jin
Ping Mei, and you'll find Chinese society in the 16th, 17th century described. So the
successful merchant or the mandarin, he gets the pick of all the rich men's daughters
and the prettiest village girls and has probably five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
different wives and concubines and many children. And the poor labourer who's dumb
and slow, he's neutered. It's like the lion or the stag that's outside the flock. He has no
harems, so he does not pass his genes down. So, in that way, a smarter population
emerges." (82)<br><br>
If Lee believes that this is the natural order of affairs for Chinese, it is no wonder
that he raised the possibility of reintroducing polygamy as part of his eugenics
programme. (83) Lee's propensity to identify intelligence with economic status seems
to have been a deep-seated trait which had been with Lee since childhood. In his old
age he told his authorised biographers, "In primary school, I had no trouble doing well.
Probably because my fellow students were poor and they were not very bright and
advantaged ... I had no trouble staying ahead of the class." (84) It must be
acknowledged that Lee was speaking retrospectively, and that his words stop just

short of explicitly drawing a direct, let alone a causal link between the economic
status of parents and the intelligence of children. His words are not, therefore,
unequivocal proof that Lee formed these ideas in childhood. They do, however,
suggest that many of his ideas of the elite are built upon the prejudices associated with
economic class. For all of Lee's supposed empirical reasoning and his theorising, his
elitism and geneticism looks suspiciously like the conceit born of a pampered and
privileged childhood.

Lee's racial hierarchy appears to have been based initially on his interpretation of
Toynbee, but Lee needed to confirm his theories by observation. Speaking of his
racial views in the 1990s, he told his biographers: "This is something which I have
read and I tested against my observations. We read many things. The fact that it's in
print and repeated by three, four authors does not make it true. They may all be wrong.
But through my own experience, meeting people, talking to them, watching them, I
conclude yes, there is this difference. Then it becomes part of the accepted facts of life,
for me." (85)<br><br>
We will probably never know all of the experiential factors which fostered Lee's
perception of racial differences, but he has intimated that his travels in Europe during
the 1940s and 1950s contributed to a perception of a European racial hierarchy similar
to that which he revealed for Asia in the 1960s. His reminiscence also indicates how
little it took to convince Lee that he was correct once he had already made up his
mind:<br><br>
"On my first visit to Germany in 1956,we had to stop in Frankfurt on our way to
London. We had [earlier] stopped in Rome. This languid Italian voice over the
loudspeaker said something ... And there were Italian workers trundling trolleys at the
airport. It was so relaxed, the atmosphere and the pace of work. Then the next stop
was Frankfurt. And immediately, the climate was a bit cooler and chillier. And a voice
came across the loudspeaker: "Achtung! Achtung! " The chaps were the same, porters,
but bigger-sized and trundling away. These were people who were defeated and
completely destroyed and they were rebuilding. I could sense the goal, the
dynamism. ... I also visited Switzerland when I was a student in '47, '48, on holiday. I
came down by train from Paris to Geneva. Paris was black bread, dirty, after the war. I
arrived at Geneva that morning, sleeping overnight. It was marvellous. Clean,
beautiful, swept streets, nice buildings, marvellous white pillowcases and sheets,
white bread after dark dirty bread and abundant food and so on. But hardworking,
punctilious, the way they did your bed and cleaned up your rooms. It told me
something about why some people succeed and some people don't. Switzerland has a
small population. If they didn't have those qualities, they would have been
overrun ...(86)<br><br>
Lee did not spell out explicitly the logic of environmental determinism, but this
passage reveals an emerging pattern in Lee's thinking. First, he is apparently blessed
with the ability to determine a culture's character from an airport stopover or froma
short holiday. Second, cultures which evolved in cooler, harsher climates were more

worthy of his admiration than those which developed in warmer and more sultry
climes. Although he did not highlight the climatic difference between Geneva and
Paris, as he did between Frankfurt and Rome, it is unlikely to be a coincidence that in
both instances Lee perceived the harsher, cooler climate as having produced the
"people who succeed."

The logic by which Lee synthesised his first principles is now evident. We know
that Lee took Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" thesis and turned it into a theory
of environmental determinism whereby the characteristics of a people, both cultural
and physiological, are largely the result of environmental influences. In his own mind,
Lee has obscured the division between culture and genetics. As he told his authorised
biographers, the "drive to protect your own offspring is ... in the genes. And built into
that is a certain cultural pattern, which varies from society to society." (87) He
considers those peoples who evolved in a harsh climate, such as the Chinese, to be
tougher, more resolute and more innovative than those who evolved in tropical climes.<br><br>
The effect of the environment on people was thus comprehensive. It affected both the
character of the civilisation which they created, and their physiology, because
inherited characteristics can, in Lee's Lamarckian view of evolution, be inherited. This
means that people who lived in an environment which required more stamina to
survive and flourish passed oil to-their offspring some of the improvements that they
inadvertently made in themselves: better genes and better ductless glands. Those of
"migrant stock" have particularly good genes because their forefathers must have had
exceptionally good glands, otherwise they could not have braved the unknown and
made a new life for themselves. Lee's great fear, however, is that the good genes
which developed through living in a harsh environment can be lost through living an
easier life in a softer climate.<br><br>
Lee's perception of the migrant's good glands is actually critical to his racial
hierarchy as it applies in Singapore, since most Singaporean Chinese are descended
from illiterate peasants who, in China's culturally eugenic society, would normally be
"neutered." Lee's emphasis on the migrant's good glands flatly contradicts his elitism,
the logic of cultural eugenicism, and his usual practice of blindly equaling economic
status with talent and intelligence. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is a
rationalisation developed specifically for the "benefit" of Southeast Asia's Chinese
population who, on the basis of his usual logic, should be dumb and slow. <br><br>The fact
that Lee resorts to such a deft piece of sophistry supports the argument that his racial
world view, as explained and defended in adulthood, is an attempt to justify his
preconceived notions of the racial hierarchy, rather than the result of dispassionate
logic applied to empirical evidence. While his adult experiences probably did
influence the development of his world view and his political thought, the essence of
his conclusions regarding the hierarchy of Asian races owes more to the prejudices he
learnt as a child than it does to his observations of the porters at Rome and Frankfurt
airports, or to his reading or Arnold Toynbee and Gunnar Myrdal. (88)<br><br>

This article has described in detail the character of Lee Kuan Yew's racial views
substantially using his own words as evidence. After a lifetime of being circumspect
on the question of race, Lee has finally spoken openly, revealing himself as
doctrinaire racist. Yet it would be a mistake to condemn Lee as a hard line racist in
every sense of the word. Such a characterisation of his views would be a distortion of
both his logic and his natural disposition. There can be no doubt that Lee is a racist in
the sense that he believes that some races and some ethnically-based cultures are
inherently superior to others. His own words leave no doubt about this assertion,
though it should be recognised that this in itself hardly makes him remarkable in Asia.<br><br>
He is also a racist in the sense that he has integrated his racial views into his political
agenda and he has created a regime which accentuates racial categorisation. This
assertion, too, is beyond dispute, yet it should be acknowledged that affirmative
action programmes in the United States and Australia are based upon racial
classifications and are widely accepted as part of modem liberal orthodoxy. Of equal
significance to our study of his political thought are the aspects of political and
personal racism that Lee has avoided by his eclectic approach. Lee's idiosyncratic
rationalisation of his racial views, for instance, has undermined the tendency to
dismiss any race as being irredeemably inferior, or unchangeably superior. He has not
conceived of any race as being supreme, even though some are more intelligent and
hardier than others. Unlike Social Darwinian racists, he does not base his views on the
assumption that any race is a lower or higher evolutionary form of humanity. <br><br>He sees
no unbridgeable divide between races. Although his environmental determinism,
Lamarckian view of evolution and cultural eugenicism may explain the higher
intelligence and better glands of those who hail from a "hard" society, they also create
a firm line of continuity between the different races, and give each race the capacity to
change for the better or the worse: hence Lee's efforts to "improve" racial
communities by "tinkering" with their cultures. (89) The result has been that despite
instances of overt racial discrimination by Lee's government, and more common
occasions of discrimination in Singaporean society, Lee has created a society which
has a relatively low level of racial tension, despite having a high level of racial
consciousness. Considering his own racial views and the nature of the society he
inherited, this is a remarkable achievement which, despite its shortcomings, should be
acknowledged.<br><br>
Our understanding of the nature of Lee's views on cultural and racial evolution
now enables us to perceive a new depth in Lee's public policies and in the
development of his political thought. More significantly, it gives us a fresh insight
into the deep fears which have driven Lee throughout his public life, and especially
since his sinicisation in the late 1970s Lee has married pessimism, progressivism and
geneticism to produce a vision of a horrible world where every step on the road to
progress creates new problems which will drag civilisation down to the depths again -
unless the elite takes charge and applies itself creatively and scientifically to
overcoming these challenges. (90) Such an attitude is, of course, the height of hubris,
but this does not concern Lee. By the late 1970s Lee was very comfortable with

hubris. <br><br>He had been almost single-handedly transforming and re-transforming the
physical, political, linguistic and cultural landscape of Singapore for nearly two
decades. He had been making and breaking careers and industries, politicians and
ideologies, and setting patterns of work, procreation and education for about two
million people. He had assumed more control of his countrymen's lives than the Pope
claims over the lives of Catholics. Furthermore, by the early 1980s ill health and old
age amongst his colleagues meant that he could now foresee the day when he would
be the last of the "old guard" left in Cabinet a paramount leader without rivals, rather
than a primus inter pares. Lee himself spoke of the difference this set of retirements
has made to Cabinet. The old guard leaders were never compliant and were forthright
in their opposition to many of Lee's policies. (91)<br><br>
After their retirement, however, he did not "waste time taking opinions all
around" the Cabinet, but simply told his colleagues what he wanted and it was up to
them to disagree. (92) One does not have to be a Western liberal to see that this
near-omnipotence and unrivalled pre-eminence is not healthy for either the nation or
the leader. Lee's new freedom, combined with his perception that cultural and
dysgenic disaster were imminent seem to have been at the heart of Lee's quixotic
approach to politics in the 1980s. His eugenics policies and the sinicization
programme converged as the complementary answers to the challenge of the West,
degenerating genes and the search for talent.<br><br>
