CAN Shanghai learn anything from Singapore's soft power?<br><br>

This was the question posed to me for my opening keynote address for the Shanghai Mayor's International Business Leadership Advisory Council (Iblac) meeting in Shanghai on Oct 27.<br><br>

I was tempted to go to the podium and say: "Nothing". It would have been my shortest speech ever.<br><br>

However, on deeper reflection, I realised that even though Shanghai's population is almost five times that of Singapore, it might learn a lesson or two from Singapore's experience. I therefore gave a speech on the seven pillars of Singapore's soft power. It was well-received by the mayor and Iblac. Hence I thought it might be worth sharing it with my fellow Singaporeans in the hope that it will generate a robust discussion and produce a more authoritative list of the key pillars of Singapore's soft power.<br><br>

Leadership and governance<br><br>

THE first pillar is obvious: exceptional leadership. The quality of mind of our founding fathers is equal to that of America's. One of them, Dr Goh Keng Swee, even became an adviser to the great Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. There is also no doubt that Mr Lee Kuan Yew is one of the best known global leaders of our time. I told my Shanghai audience that even though he is highly respected in the West, he never hesitated to convey hard truths to Western audiences. One of Dr Henry Kissinger's favourite stories is about how Mr Lee once told a distinguished group of Harvard professors at the height of the Vietnam War: "You make me sick". Mr Lee has clearly put Singapore on the global map.<br><br>

The second pillar is good governance. As I tell every student of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, Singapore's success is based on three key elements: meritocracy, pragmatism and honesty (with honesty being the toughest part). Fortunately, even though rule of law is a Western concept, it works equally well for Eastern societies.<br><br>

I emphasised that in Singapore the law stands above the Government. The entire Cabinet is subject to the same laws as the rest of us. Hence, when a former law minister was found to have been driving recklessly, he was charged in court for driving without care. No one in Singapore is above the law.<br><br>

Multiculturalism, language
<br><br>
THE third pillar is multiculturalism. I emphasised that four major world civilisations interact on a daily basis in small Singapore: Chinese, Malay-Muslim, Indian and Western. It is not necessarily an easy thing for people of different cultures to get along. Hence, there are strong laws in Singapore against racial and religious insensitivity, and regulations to ensure that minorities are represented in each public housing estate. Few other societies in the world could match Singapore's record in managing multiculturalism.<br><br>

The fourth pillar is the English language. Indeed, Singapore is possibly the city whose people have the strongest English-speaking skills in Asia. Each Singaporean child is taught both English and his or her mother tongue. Exposure to the English language does not just provide linguistic skills. It opens windows into the rich heritage of Western civilisation, giving Singaporeans another competitive edge.
<br><br>
Food and environment<br><br>

THE fifth pillar is food. As Mr George Yeo has famously said, eating is the "tao" of Singapore. Singaporeans feel comfortable eating several different cuisines in one day, or even in one meal. I told the story of how the butler at the official Malaysian guesthouse was shocked one morning when then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked for Indian thosai for breakfast. Peranakan cuisine is also a local innovation, with the mother of Mr Lee Kuan Yew having produced one of the best cookbooks in this area. As I learnt later, this revelation surprised the Shanghai audience.
<br><br>
The sixth pillar is the green environment. Singapore is only one-fifth the size of Rhode Island, the smallest state in the United States. Yet it has more tree species than the entire 48 continental states of the United States combined. Singapore also has Tree Planting Day every year, to emphasise the importance of staying green.
<br><br>
Open to the world
<br><br>
FINALLY, the seventh pillar is that Singapore is the most open and globalised country in the world. Singapore's total trade is 31/2 times the size of its gross domestic product (GDP). This is one of the reasons the World Bank ranked Singapore as the easiest country in the world in which to do business. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as the third most competitive city in the world after New York and London.
<br><br>
Given the current sceptical environment in Singapore, I would not be surprised if some Singaporeans react to this list with the comment: "So what? Other cities got lists also, what." That is true. Other countries also have their lists. But the combination of these seven elements gives Singapore a truly unique position in the world, as I emphasised to the audience in Shanghai.
<br><br>
Soft power depends a lot on the global context. In the 19th century, when Europe was dominant, London and Paris dazzled and attracted the world with their soft power. But times have changed. Power is shifting from the West to East. But the West is not finished. It will remain the world's strongest civilisation for some time to come. Hence, the cities that will do well in the area of soft power will be those that bring together the best of the East and the best of the West. This is where Singapore stands out.
<br><br>
Dual identity
<br><br>
SINGAPOREANS enjoy a unique dual identity of living in the most Asian modern city (Seoul and Tokyo remain fundamentally Korean and Japanese cities respectively), as well as being the most Westernised. All this brings me to the key aspect of Singapore's soft power that I emphasised in Shanghai.
<br><br>
If Singapore can continue its practice of bringing together the best of the East and the best of the West in one city, it may provide a hopeful example to a world that believes that it will be difficult for the East and West to live together. Hence, if we succeed in Singapore with our soft power, we may be achieving something that is globally significant, even in the metaphysical dimension.
<br><br>
And, why do I say metaphysical? Rudyard Kipling once famously said: "Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet." Many in the world today still believe that Kipling was right.
<br><br>
Hence, if Singapore can bring together the East and West, this will change our dominant global world view (Weltanschauung). Anything that changes our Weltanschauung is metaphysically significant.

	新加坡“以房养老”<br><br>
	形式多样的新加坡“以房养老” <br><br>2013年12月30日  学习时报 作者：徐田华<br><br>

	新加坡共有510万人，60岁以上的老年人有11.73万，占总人口的23%。在新加坡，55岁以上的老年人被称为乐龄人士。作为一个非福利性国家，新加坡政府一向倡导国人自食其力，政府并不鼓励父母留房给儿女，因为新加坡已经制定了年轻人可以自己买房的计划。建屋发展局为年轻夫妇提供组屋（即组合房屋，简称组屋，由新加坡建屋发展局承担建筑的楼房，为大部分人的住所）的购屋津贴，帮助他们获得住房的“第一把钥匙”；当他们年老时，他们将获得住房的“第二把钥匙”，即各种从组屋套现的选择，以确保他们在退休后仍然有收入来源。新加坡政府已陆续推出一系列通过住房套现的措施，为老年人解决“有房产，没现金”的生活窘境。在拥屋率极高的新加坡，以房养老是常见的养老模式。<br><br>

　　新加坡“以房养老”的多种形式<br><br>

　　新加坡有三种形式的“以房养老”：一是通过出租部分或者全部居室来换取养老收入，二是通过“以大换小”获得养老收入，三是平常所说的倒按揭，也就是反向。每种形式都与政府密切相关。前两种主要针对新加坡政府出资建造的组屋，第三种则主要针对私人建造的商品房。新加坡“住房养老”的三种模式具体如下。<br><br>

　　第一种是允许符合条件的组屋拥有者出租全部或者部分居室来换取养老收入。新加坡政府允许老年人通过出租整套组屋或组屋的某间空房获得一定收入。国家发展部的一项最新调查显示，新加坡有25.4万年满55岁的组屋屋主，占屋主总数的30%，其中近八成已经付清组屋贷款。在这些老年人中，出租整套组屋或某间空房的人约占总数的1/10。<br><br>

　　第二种是老年夫妇可以将现有的较大面积的住房置换成较小面积的住房，通过“以大换小”获得养老收入。对于一些原来居住在较大面积的退休夫妇来说，如果子女长大成人并且已经搬到其他地方居住，老年夫妇可以将现有住房置换成面积较小的住房，以大换小后获得的净收入用作老年日常开支，或者投资一些风险小的产品来获得收益。当事人还可以根据经济状况选择一次性或者分步地完成住房的以大换小。
<br><br>
　　此外，20世纪90年代末，新加坡推出“乐龄公寓”计划，即专门为独居或只和老伴居住的老年人提供一种乐龄公寓，这类公寓通常面积在40平方米左右，价格低廉，一般只需五六万新元即可购买。乐龄公寓一般都建在成熟社区内，各种设施齐全完善，公共交通便利。此类公寓使用权一般为30年，可延长使用期但不能转让和继承。<br><br>

　　今年2月份，新加坡政府又开始正式实施“乐龄安居花红计划”。这一计划鼓励老年人卖掉现有大型组屋，搬到三房式或更小（相当于两居室或更小）的组屋或小型公寓，以领取乐龄安居花红，这一花红最多也可达2万新元。不过大屋换小屋所得收益也须有一定数额填补老人的公积金退休户头，剩余部分则可全数提取现金。<br><br>

　　第三种就是平常所说的倒按揭，也叫反向，主要是针对私人建造的商品房。在新加坡，60岁以上的老年人可以申请将房子抵押给有政府背景的公益性机构或金融机构，由这些机构一次性或分期支付养老金。老人仍居住在自己的住房内，待其去世后，房屋产权由这些机构处置，抵押变现并结算利息，剩余的钱则交给其继承人。<br><br>

　　具有官方背景的职总英康保险合作社，早在1997年就率先向私人房地产业主推出了住房反向抵押贷款。由于该住房反向抵押贷款设计有追索权，所以存在着追讨的隐患，即一旦贷款的本利和超过房屋价值，屋主或其继承人就必须负担超过部分的归还，这会使屋主担心由于长寿导致本利和超过贷款而被迫出售房屋。此外，该产品仅限于私人建造的商品住房，而在新加坡占比80%以上的政府组屋不能参与住房反向抵押贷款。这些问题导致反向抵押贷款发挥的作用大大缩水。<br><br>

　　从2006年3月开始，新加坡政府宣布将这一计划扩大到覆盖新加坡八成居民人口的政府组屋市场。70岁至90岁之间的政府组屋屋主，可以通过职总英康的反向抵押贷款套现，每月领取生活费，直至贷款期满。贷款机构会在贷款期满或屋主去世之后，把房子卖掉，以索回贷款额，或让申请者的家人还清贷款来取回屋子。
<br><br>
　　2009年，新加坡政府推出屋契回购计划，即达到公积金最低存款提取年龄的老年人（现在为63岁），只要家庭月收入不超过3000新元，并且名下没有其他房产，他们就可以将所居住的二房或三房式组屋（相当于一居室或两居室）最后剩余屋契，卖给国家发展部下属法定机构建屋发展局套现，然后以30年租约继续住在同一间组屋中。
<br><br>
　　新加坡“以房养老”存在的问题
<br><br>
　　尽管新加坡多样的“以房养老”形式，满足了不同层次公民的养老需求，但是“第二把钥匙”尚在探索阶段，还存在以下一些问题。
<br><br>
　　“乐龄安居花红计划”响应者不多。一方面因为老年人一般不太愿意远离老邻居、老朋友，搬离已经非常熟悉的居住环境，另一方面也由于计划的相关条例和手续过于复杂，参与者能拿到的现金不多。建屋局的数据显示，迄今乐龄安居花红计划的申请者只有23个，获得批准的有13个，社会反响较为平淡。
<br><br>
　　以市场为主导的“反向抵押贷款计划”成效不显著。2006年，“反向抵押贷款计划”推出后并没有像政府预期的那样引起较大反响。据新加坡本地媒体《亚洲新闻台》2007年3月报道说，经过一年运行，职总英康的反向抵押贷款计划仅有10例成功签约，本地三家主要银行也基于暗淡的市场反应，宣布放弃或推迟推出这一逆按揭产品。与美国、韩国等以政府出面担保的“以房养老”不同，新加坡“反向抵押贷款计划”是以保险公司、银行机构主导的市场行为。私人金融机构为保护自己利益开出的一系列条款，反向按揭不仅有金融贷款上的风险，还包括人的寿命、违约等方面的风险，比一般正向按揭的情况要复杂，这些都降低了老年人对“反向抵押贷款计划”的热度。
<br><br>
　　“屋契回购计划”也缺乏吸引力。根据新加坡国家发展部6月份公布的数据，“屋契回购计划”自2009年推出，只有474名申请者。因为政府规定屋契套现的净收益优先填补公积金账户，剩余部分才能以现金形式提出，实际上对一些年长有宅但缺少现金来源的年长者，并没有起到较好的套现作用。
<br><br>
　　虽然新加坡“以房养老”制度仍在探索中，但是多样的“以房养老”形式作为国际经验值得借鉴。此外，需要指出的是：所有采取“以房养老”的发达国家，都拥有由公共财政支持的良好基本养老服务体系，“以房养老”只是一种补充性的养老选择。

DER SPIEGEL Interview with Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew<br><br>

 "It's Stupid to be Afraid" <br><br>
  

Singapore's first-ever prime minister, long-time government head and current political mentor Lee Kuan Yew talks about Asia's rise to economic power, China's ambitions and the West's chances of staying competitive.<br><br>
 The elder statesman Lee: "We run a meritocracy."<br><br>
 
The elder statesman Lee: "We run a meritocracy."<br><br>
 SPIEGEL : The political and economic center of gravity is moving from the West towards the East. Is Asia becoming the dominant political and economic force in this century?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: I wouldn't say it's the dominant force. What is gradually happening is the restoration of the world balance to what it was in the early 19th century or late 18th century when China and India together were responsible for more than 40 percent of world GDP. With those two countries becoming part of the globalized trading world, they are going to go back to approximately the level of world GDP that they previously occupied. But that doesn't make them the superpowers of the world.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: Their leading politicians have publicly discussed the so-called "Asian Century".<br><br>

Mr. Lee: Yes, economically, there will be a shift to the Pacific from the Atlantic Ocean and you can already see that in the shipping volumes of Chinese ports. Every shipping line is trying to get into association with a Chinese container port. India is slower because their infrastructure is still to be completed. But I think they will join in the race, build roads, bridges, airports, container ports and they'll become a manufacturing hub. Raw materials go in, finished goods go out.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: You've been the leader of a very successful state for a long time. Returning from your time in China, are you afraid for Singapore's future?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: I saw it coming from the late 1980s. Deng Xiaoping started this in 1978. He visited Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore in November 1978. I think that visit shocked him because he expected three backward cities. Instead he saw three modern cities and he knew that communism -- the politics of the iron rice bowl -- did not work. So, at the end of December, he announced his open door policy. He started free trade zones and from there, they extended it and extended it. Now they have joined the WTO and the whole country is a free trade zone.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: But has China's success not become dangerous for Singapore?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: We have watched this transformation and the speed at which it is happening. As many of my people tell me, it's scary. They learn so fast. Our people set up businesses in Shanghai or Suzhou and they employ Chinese at lower wages than Singapore Chinese. After three years, they say: "Look, I can do that work, I want the same pay." So it is a very serious challenge for us to move aside and not collide with them. We have to move to areas where they cannot move.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Such as?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: Such as where the rule of law, intellectual property and security of production systems are required, because for them to establish that, it will take 20 to 30 years. We are concentrating on bio medicine, pharmaceuticals and all products requiring protection of intellectual property rights. No pharmaceutical company is going to go have its precious patents disclosed. So that is why they are here in Singapore and not in China.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: But the Chinese are moving too. They bought parts of IBM and are trying to take over the American oil company Unocal.<br><br>

Mr. Lee: They are learning. They have learnt takeovers and mergers from the Americans. They know that if they try to sell their computers with a Chinese brand it will take them decades in America, but if they buy IBM, they can inject their technology and low cost into IBM's brand name, and they will gain access to the market much faster.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: But how afraid should the West be?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: It's stupid to be afraid. It's going to happen. I console myself this way. Suppose, China had never gone communist in 1949, suppose the Nationalist government had worked with the Americans -- China would be the great power in Asia -- not Japan, not Korea, not Hong Kong, not Singapore. Because China isolated itself, development took place on the periphery of Asia first.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Such a consolation won't be enough for the future.
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: Right. In 50 years I see China, Korea and Japan at the high-tech end of the value chain. Look at the numbers and quality of the engineers and scientists they produce and you know that this is where the R&amp;D will be done. The Chinese have a space programme, they're going to put a man on the Moon and nobody sold them that technology. We have to face that. But you should not be afraid of that. You are leading in many fields which they cannot catch up with for many years, many decades. In pharmaceuticals, I don't see them catching up with the Germans for a long time.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: That wouldn't feed anybody who works for Opel, would it?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: A motor car is a commodity -- four wheels, a chassis, a motor. You can have modifications up and down, but it remains a commodity, and the Chinese can do commodities.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: When you look to Western Europe, do you see a possible collapse of the society because of the overwhelming forces of globalization?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: No. I see ten bitter years. In the end, the workers, whether they like it or not, will realize, that the cosy European world which they created after the war has come to an end.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: How so?
<br><br>
 
 Mr. Lee: The social contract that led to workers sitting on the boards of companies and everybody being happy rested on this condition: I work hard, I restore Germany's prosperity, and you, the state, you have to look after me. I'm entitled to go to Baden Baden for spa recuperation one month every year. This old system was gone in the blink of an eye when two to three billion people joined the race -- one billion in China, one billion in India and over half-a-billion in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: The question is: How do you answer that challenge?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: Chancellor Kohl tried to do it. He did it halfway then he had to pause. Schroeder tried to do it, now he's in a jam and has called an election. Merkel will go in and push, then she will get hammered before she can finish the job, but each time, they will push the restructuring a bit forward.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: You think it's too slow?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: It is painful because it is so slow. If your workers were rational they would say, yes, this is going to happen anyway, let's do the necessary things in one go. Instead of one month at the spa, take one week at the spa, work harder and longer for the same pay, compete with the East Europeans, invent in new technology, put more money into your R&amp;D, keep ahead of the Chinese and the Indians.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: You have seen yourself how hard it is to implement such strategies.<br><br>

Mr. Lee: I faced this problem myself. Every year, our unions and the Labour Department subsidize trips to China and India. We tell the participants: Don't just look at the Great Wall but go to the factories and ask, "What are you paid?" What hours do you work?" And they come back shell-shocked. The Chinese had perestroika first, then glasnost. That's where the Russians made their mistake.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: The Chinese Government is promoting the peaceful rise of China. Do you believe them?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: Yes, I do, with one reservation. I think they have calculated that they need 30 to 40 -- maybe 50 years of peace and quiet to catch up, to build up their system, change it from the communist system to the market system. They must avoid the mistakes made by Germany and Japan. Their competition for power, influence and resources led in the last century to two terrible wars.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: What should the Chinese do differently?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: They will trade, they will not demand, "This is my sphere of influence, you keep out". America goes to South America and they also go to South America. Brazil has now put aside an area as big as the state of Massachusetts to grow soya beans for China. They are going to Sudan and Venezuela for oil because the Venezuelan President doesn't like America. They are going to Iran for oil and gas. So, they are not asking for a military contest for power, but for an economic competition.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: But would anybody take them really seriously without military power?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: About eight years ago, I met Liu Huaqing, the man who built the Chinese Navy. Mao personally sent him to Leningrad to learn to build ships. I said to him, "The Russians made very rough, crude weapons". He replied, "You are wrong. They made first-class weapons, equal to the Americans." The Russian mistake was that they put so much into military expenditure and so little into civilian technology. So their economy collapsed. I believe the Chinese leadership have learnt: If you compete with America in armaments, you will lose. You will bankrupt yourself. So, avoid it, keep your head down, and smile, for 40 or 50 years.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: What are your reservations?<br><br>
  Mr. Lee: I don't know whether the next generation will stay on this course. After 15 or 20 years they may feel their muscles are very powerful. We know the mind of the leaders but the mood of the people on the ground is another matter. Because there's no more communist ideology to hold the people together, the ground is now galvanised by Chinese patriotism and nationalism. Look at the anti-Japanese demonstrations.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: How do you explain that China is spending billions on military modernisation right now?<br><br>

Mr. Lee: Their modernisation is just a drop in the ocean. Their objective is to raise the level of damage they can deliver to the Americans if they intervene in Taiwan. Their objective is not to defeat the Americans, which they cannot do. They know they will be defeated. They want to weaken the American resolve to intervene. That is their objective, but they do not want to attack Taiwan.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: Really? They have just passed the aggressive anti-secession law and a general has threatened to use the nuclear bomb.<br><br>

Mr. Lee: I think they have put themselves into a position internationally that if Taiwan declares independence, they must react and if Beijing's leadership doesn't, they would be finished, they would be a paper tiger and they know that. So, they passed the anti-secession law to tell the Taiwanese and the Americans and the Japanese, "I do not want to fight, but if you allow Taiwan to go for independence, I will have to fight." I think the anti-secession law is a law to preserve the status quo.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: Another critical point in Asia is the growing rivalry between China and Japan.
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: It's been dormant all this while, right? But I think several things happened that upped the ante. They possibly coincide with the policy of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. There is this return to "we want to be a normal country." They are sending ships to Afghanistan to support the Americans, they sent a battalion to Iraq, they reclaimed the Senkaku islands, and most recently, they joined the Americans in declaring that Taiwan is a strategic interest of Japan and America. That raises all the historical memories of the Japanese taking away Taiwan in 1895. Then they're applying to be a permanent member of the Security Council. So, I think the Chinese decided that this is too much. So, they have openly said they will object to Japan becoming a member of the Security Council.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Well, the United States said the same to Germany.
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: Exactly. So, the whole process is trying to define the position for the next round, maybe in 10 to 15 years, by which time the world will be a different place.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Can the Chinese convince their North Korean ally Kim Jong-Il to get rid of his nuclear program?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: North Korea is a riddle wrapped up in an enigma. The leaders in North Korea believe that their survival depends upon having a bomb -- at least one nuclear bomb. Otherwise, sooner or later, they will collapse and the leaders will be put on trial like Milosevic for all the crimes that they have committed. And they have no intention of letting that happen.<br><br>

SPIEGEL: Who can stop them? The Americans?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: Yes, but at a price, a heavy price.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Could the Chinese do it?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: Possibly. By denying food, denying fuel, so they would implode. But will the Chinese benefit from an imploded North Korea? That brings the South into the North. That brings the Americans to the Yalu River. So, the North Koreans have also done their calculations and know that there are limits.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: So Kim is in a strong position?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: If I were Kim I would freeze the programme, tell the Americans you can inspect, but if you attack me, I will use it. That leaves the Americans with the problem of checking and verifying and intercepting ships, aircraft, endless problems.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Would that save Kim's regime?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: In the long run I think they will implode sooner or later because their system cannot survive. They can see China, they can see Russia and Vietnam, all opening up. If they open up, their system of control of the people will break down. So they must go.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: If the six party talks fail, do you foresee an arms race in Eastern Asia?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: If the nuclear program is frozen, there won't be an arms race. Eventually, it is not in China's interests to have an erratic Korea nuclear-armed and a Japan nuclear-armed. That reduces China's position.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: Many Americans fear that China and the US are bound to become strategic rivals. Will this become the great rivalry of the 21st century?
<br><br>
 
 Mr. Lee: Rivals, yes, but not necessarily enemies. The Chinese have spent a lot of energy and time to make sure that their periphery is friendly to them. So, they settled with Russia, they have settled with India. They're going to have a free trade agreement with India -- they're learning from each other. Instead of quarrelling with the Philippines and the Vietnamese over oil in the South China Sea, they have agreed on joint exploration and sharing. They've agreed on a strategic agreement with Indonesia for bilateral trade and technology.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: But the Americans are trying to encircle China. They have won new bases in Central Asia.
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: The Chinese are very conscious of being encircled by allies of America. But they are very good in countering those moves. South Korea today has the largest number of foreign students in China. They see their future in China. So, the only country that's openly on America's side is Japan. All the others are either neutral or friendly to China.
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: During your career, you have kept your distance from Western style democracy. Are you still convinced that an authoritarian system is the future for Asia?
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: Why should I be against democracy? The British came here, never gave me democracy, except when they were about to leave. But I cannot run my system based on their rules. I have to amend it to fit my people's position. In multiracial societies, you don't vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests, you vote in accordance with race and religion. Supposing I'd run their system here, Malays would vote for Muslims, Indians would vote for Indians, Chinese would vote for Chinese. I would have a constant clash in my Parliament which cannot be resolved because the Chinese majority would always overrule them. So I found a formula that changes that...
<br><br>
SPIEGEL: ... and that turned Singapore de facto into a one party state. Critics say that Singapore resembles a Lee Family Enterprise. Your son is the Prime Minister, your daughter-in-law heads the powerful Development Agency...
<br><br>
Mr. Lee: ... and my other son is CEO of Singapore Telecoms, my daughter is head of the National Institute for Neurology. This is a very small community of 4 million people. We run a meritocracy. If the Lee Family set an example of nepotism, that system would collapse. If I were not the prime minister, my son could have become Prime Minister several years earlier. It is against my interest to allow any family member who's incompetent to hold an important job because that would be a disaster for Singapore and my legacy. That cannot be allowed.

LEE KUAN YEW - INTERVIEW WITH ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE 2008  <br><br>


Lee Kuan Yew with Charlie rose <br><br>


 UPI Editor at Large Arnaud de Borchgrave interviewed Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on Feb. 2. The following is the text of the interview.  <br><br>

TRANSCRIPT:   <br><br>
UPI: How do you see Iraq? <br><br>

Lee: I do not want to say anything that would hurt President Bush because I believe he went in with the best of intentions. He put his trust in Dick Cheney. And I had trust in Dick Cheney as the voice of experience -- oil business executive, defense secretary during the first Gulf War (1990-91). But I don't know what happened to Dick Cheney. He allowed himself to believe with Richard Perle and the neocons you could change Iraq. How could you change Iraq, a 4,000-year-old society that is not malleable? Everybody knows the troubles the British had during and after World War I. Ideology should have no place when making geopolitical assessments. <br><br>

George W. Bush, whatever his faults, is not walking away from what was started, which is just as well otherwise further damage will be done. <br><br>

Q: And the next president? <br><br>

A: Of all the candidates who will inherit the problem, I prefer John McCain. He will see this thing through. Walking away from it would also have disastrous consequences. If Afghanistan is a failed state, it's not your fault. No one has ever made sense out of it. But if you leave Iraq in its present state, you will have even bigger problems throughout the entire Middle East. The Shiites will get together. The Iraqi Shia will become dependent on Iran, and the Iranians will have mastery of that critically important Gulf area. <br><br>

Q: So what is your recommendation about Iran's nuclear ambitions? <br><br>

A: Is it now unstoppable. They are a very old civilization. Unlike the Arabs, apart from Mesopotamia valley, they rank with the Chinese, as history's two principal civilizations worth talking about. And I think the mullahs and others want to go back to the days of empire. <br><br>

Q: So should we be talking to them at the highest level, the way Henry Kissinger went to China? <br><br>

A: (Chuckle) But you haven't got a Kissinger or a Brzezinski to do that anymore. Where is the successor generation of geopoliticians? <br><br>

Q: In fact, democracies don't produce great statesmen anymore. Why? <br><br>

A: You now have, and I don't know how long this phase will last, mass media domination, owned by a group of media barons who want constant change for their balance sheets. <br><br>

Q: So the power of mass media has made it impossible for a great statesman or woman to emerge and last any length of time?
 <br><br>
A: I'm not sure. It depends on the nature of the crisis that must be faced. When a real crisis sets in, a matter of life and death, opinion formulators realize this is no time to be pontificating, but a time to stay the course with someone who understands what this is all about. Short of that, the media help put a leader on the pedestal and then start chopping away at the pedestal until he/she falls in disgrace. That's part of the cycle of constant change. Watch Sarkozy in France. They hoisted him up to prominence and now they're already attempting to bring him down through his personal life.
 <br><br>
Q: But didn't Sarkozy contribute to what you call the cycle?
 <br><br>
A: Well, yes. But it's also the enormous pressure of media competition and the giant appetite for advertising revenue, what television program gets what viewership, or eyeballs, or clicks online. Never mind the consequences. If you get the advertising, you win. <br><br>

Q: We have a whole new generation that doesn't read newspapers, but get their news online. The average age of a newspaper reader in the United States today is 55. <br><br>

A: So I'm a dinosaur (laughs). <br><br>

Q: When I last interviewed you in May 2001, I asked you what concerned you most about the next 10 years, and you replied, "an Islamist bomb, and mark my words, it will travel." Four months later, we had Sept. 11. Secondly you said, "China and India's challenge to the global status quo." Do you still have the same concerns about the next 10 years?
 <br><br>
A: Not quite. The Islamic bomb has traveled already (in Iran). I'm not sure how this will now play out. The U.S., the Europeans, even the Russians, will have to make up their minds whether to allow Iran to go nuclear. The Russians are playing a game, posing as the nice guys with Iran, supplying nuclear fuel, and making it look as if America is causing all this trouble. But if I were Russia today, I would be very worried about Iran acquiring the bomb, because Russia is more at risk than America. The risk Israel runs is another dimension. Russia is at risk because whether it's the Chechens or Central Asian Muslim states that were former Soviet republics, none are friendly to Moscow. Next time there's an explosion in Moscow, it may be a suicide bomber who isn't wearing an explosive belt or jacket, but something a lot bigger. It would certainly be in Russia's interest to say at some future point to Iran, "this far and no further." It could also be that Russia no longer knows how to stop it, in which case the Russians will be opening the door to a very dangerous world of nuclear proliferation. You can be quite sure that if and when Iran gets the bomb, the Middle East will go nuclear.
 <br><br>
Q: Which raises the question of the United States or Israel bombing Iran's nuclear facilities.
 <br><br>
A: (long silent pause)  I can express no views on that.
 <br><br>
Q: The Israelis say they are facing an existential crisis.
 <br><br>
A: No question, they are at risk.
 <br><br>
Q: As I travel in moderate Muslim states in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, I ask heads of state and government how many extremists, or would-be jihadis, they estimate live in their midst, also how many fundamentalists who support openly or secretly the jihadi cause. The answer is usually 1 percent and 10 percent. In a country like Pakistan, that translates to 1.6 million extremists and 16 million supporters. On a global scale, that comes out to roughly 14 million extremists and 140 million sympathizers.
 <br><br>
A: Yes, but I do not see them winning, and by that I mean able to impose their extremist system. I can see them inducing fear and insecurity, and causing fear, but they don't have the technology and the organization to overwhelm any government.
 <br><br>
Q: So how do you assess the global threat since Sept. 11? What are we doing that's right and also that's wrong?
 <br><br>
A: Even if we can't win, we mustn't lose or tire. We cannot allow them to believe they have a winning strategy, and that more suicide bombers and WMD will advance their cause and give them a chance to take over.
 <br><br>
Q: So we're doing the right thing?
 <br><br>
A: No. Iraq was a mistake. I've said this before and I said this in the presence of Paul Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the invasion, at an IISS conference two months after the fall of Saddam Hussein, when someone asked me what will happen in Iraq. In October 2002, I was in Washington and became quite convinced an invasion would take place. On the way home, I stopped in London and asked Tony Blair to brief me. After 45 minutes, I said, "Look I accept the argument that with British and American military capabilities it would be a walk over, but then what do you do the day after? Blair replied, "That's up to the Americans." I then said to Blair, "If you were in charge, what would you do?" His political adviser then stepped in and said, "We would appoint the strongest pro-Western general and then get out quickly." So I repeated all that at the IISS conference and explained this reflected the institutional memory of what the British had been through in Iraq in the early 1920s. Paul Wolfowitz stood up in high dudgeon. So to placate him, I said, "Of course the British don't have the resources you have." <br><br>

Q: Did Wolfowitz ask anything of you?
 <br><br>
A: Yes, he came to my office to ask that Singapore send police trainers to Iraq. I had known Paul since his days as an ambassador at the State Department. I said, "Paul, do you realize how long it takes to train a policeman in Singapore? And that's only in one language, English, and it still takes two years. And you want me to teach Iraqis how to do it in three months in English? No, he replied, we'll supply translators. This is an emergency, he said, and many nations are helping us. So I replied OK, but we'll do it in Amman, Jordan, not Baghdad, where we would become the targets of suicide bombers. When he told me they had disbanded Saddam's police force, I became very nervous. Because when the Japanese came down here in World War II, 20,000 of their troops captured 90,000 British, Indian and Australian troops. They sent them into captivity, but they left the local police in charge, and kept all the other positions of the British administration intact -- from power management to the gas board -- and simply put Japanese in charge of each British position. And 20,000 Japanese troops moved on to Java. But in Iraq, you disbanded everything, and tried to run things without the former Baath party officials who had been in charge of civil administration. You created an ungovernable vacuum.
 <br><br>
Q: Why do you think this was so?
 <br><br>
A: From Day One, the idea of remaking Iraq, without the civil service in place and without recalling Saddam's army to service, showed a frightening lack of understanding of local conditions and elementary facts of political and economic life in Iraq. In ancient days, those who invaded and conquered China on horseback got off their horses and applied themselves to the more difficult job of governing.
 <br><br>
Q: Did Iraq have anything to do with al-Qaida?
 <br><br>
A: Of course not, as became clear in the daily sessions the imprisoned Saddam spent with his Arabic-speaking FBI interrogator over several months before his execution. But U.S. authorities were convinced Saddam was secretly supporting al-Qaida with weapons and training and maybe even WMD. So therefore the imperative became the elimination of Saddam.
 <br><br>
Q: Switching to Pakistan, most terrorist trails in the United Kingdom and most recently in Germany via Turkey, track back to training camps and madrassas in the tribal areas that straddle the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
 <br><br>
A: We even had a terrorist of Pakistani descent here in Singapore.
 <br><br>
Q: So what's your view of what should be done about the Pakistan-terrorist nexus?
 <br><br>
A: (Laughs for several seconds) We should learn to live with it for a long time. My fear is Pakistan may well get worse. What is the choice? (President) Musharraf is the only general I know who is totally secular in his approach. But he's got to maneuver between his extremists who are sympathetic to Taliban and al-Qaida and moderate elements with a Western outlook. We forget that right after Sept. 11 he was given a stark choice by President Bush: either you abandon your support of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan or face the disintegration of Pakistan. There is an interesting study of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency that says 20 percent of the Pakistani army's officer corps is fundamentalist.
 <br><br>
Q: So what do you feel the United States can do there now?
 <br><br>
A: There is very little, if anything, the U.S. can do to influence the course of events in Pakistan that wouldn't make matters worse. Any U.S. interference in Pakistan would result in Pakistan's four provinces becoming four failed states. And then what happens to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal? It's a horrendous festering problem. The Feb. 18 elections may bring a little clarity and hopefully democratic stability to Pakistan, but I am not holding my breath.
 <br><br>
Q: But Afghanistan cannot be stabilized until Taliban and al-Qaida are flushed out of FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), failing which we could see the collapse of NATO in Afghanistan?
 <br><br>
A: I'm surprised at NATO, some of whose members have such short memories. They can't seem to project into the future their experiences of the past. Do they believe the Russians have been defanged forever? Do they believe Europe is at peace and can remain at peace forever? This is a globalized world. So for NATO members to balk at casualties when America came to rescue them in two world wars, I simply cannot fathom. I guess it has to do with the mood in Europe, which is appeasement, and the shift from papa Bush to Madeleine Albright as the indispensable power with an uncertain trumpet, and then, of course, the neocons who persuaded the Europeans that it was America's show, and no longer theirs. Supposing America had kept to the papa Bush line of thinking and coalition building, Europe would have understood that while they are targeting America today, Europe would be next.
 <br><br>
Q: So you do feel that NATO's future is at stake in Afghanistan?
 <br><br>
A: No doubt about it. But you should also realize Afghanistan cannot succeed as a democracy. You attempted too much. Let the warlords sort it out in such a way you don't try to build a new state. The British tried it and failed. Just make clear if they commit aggression again and offer safe haven to Taliban, they will be punished.
 <br><br>
Q: If NATO collapsed in the wake of a failed campaign in Afghanistan, would that be a major concern of yours in Singapore?
 <br><br>
A: Not immediately, but overall the balance of power would be upset.
 <br><br>
Q: In whose favor?
 <br><br>


A: China and Russia. They would be faced with a much weakened West in the ongoing global contest. I can also see the danger if America loses heart and says to hell with it all because the Europeans are not helping and the Japanese are blocking this and that, and tokenism from all the others. Let's not forget that what we're all enjoying today is the result of Pax Britannica and Pax America over the past 100 years. So don't give it up.
 <br><br>
Q: In the next 12 months, China, in this New Year of the Rat (Feb. 7) that you are now celebrating, will mark its transformation in the past three decades from one of the poorest countries in the 20th century into the world's third-largest economy, soon to displace Germany, as the globe's new engine room of economic growth. Will China be to the 21st century what America was to the 20th?
 <br><br>
A: The Chinese leadership has come to the conclusion if they stay on their present course, the peaceful rise of China's power will prevail. They are determined not to challenge any existing power, meaning America, EU, Russia, but just make friends with everybody. Given the rules of the game now that China is in WTO, they can only grow stronger year by year, and within three or four decades, China's GDP will be equal to America's, their technology will be equal to what was long regarded as the world's only superpower, and their GDP will be larger than America's. And all that stems from what they have long studied in detail in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. When Deng Xiaoping came to Singapore he was amazed at what he saw, as his briefing papers did not tally with his own eyes. That's when he must have concluded the Communist system didn't work. He could see how we were exploiting Western capitalism and had plants all over the place with cheaper labor and exporting goods all over the world. Hell's bells, he said, we can do that, too. That's when China began setting up special economic zones around coastal cities. They saw Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore with the advantages of close ties with the West, access to Western technology, export markets, knowledge, capital and an educated workforce. Now with WTO, they are on the same course, sending 250,000 students abroad every year, and even though they may lose 60 percent to 70 percent of them to other countries, they don't care because they know many of them will come back eventually. Year by year, they're closing the gap.
 <br><br>
Q: And all this peacefully?
 <br><br>
A: I watched "The Rise of the Great Powers" and I was amazed at this scholarly job by noted historians. No Communist or leftist jargon. How did some of these powers rise in history? Tiny little Portugal? Naval technology, pure and simple. Christopher Columbus? Spain? Tiny Holland, the French, the British, the armada, what was the trick? Technology plus governments that united the people in a common objective toward growth.
 <br><br>
Q: Can the Chinese keep a one-party state going in this age of mass media, the Internet, and almost 100 million blogs?
 <br><br>
A: I was quite surprised when this television program analyzed the British rise to global power status. The barons brought the king to Magna Carta, and said you will rule through us, Parliament, not divine right, but divine right through us. And when the king misbehaved, such as Charles I, he was beheaded. It was subversive to advocate cutting off the head of the Communist Party, but in today's China the people have confidence in the leaders because they allowed the once-hated merchant class to emerge and grow. That's the same dynamics that once created the East India Company and created an empire.
 <br><br>
Q: So you see China on the same glide path?
 <br><br>
A: I think so. But they want to avoid building a pre-World War II Japan or a Germany. Territorial conquest is not necessary as it once was. You don't have to be a genius to know that they are producing five times as many engineers and scientists as the Americans. What is it they need most now? Roads, railways, infrastructure. They are everywhere in Africa, in the Arab world, Latin America. China is everywhere today. Can you be everywhere while focused on Iraq? In the Caribbean you have one embassy in Barbados that serves six other tiny island countries. The Chinese have an embassy in each place. And that's what you call your front yard.
 <br><br>
Q: Are you saying this will be China's century?
 <br><br>
A: No, no, I don't think so. They will want to share this century as co-equals. By 2030, it will be a different world. They won't invade Taiwan and try to take over militarily. That would be far too costly for them all over the world. The U.S. Pacific commander said, "Look, you've got all these forces trained to knock off our 7th Fleet and if Taiwan declares its independence you will have to move. I would be quite happy to leave it as it is, but not Beijing." In my opinion, Chinese leaders would also be happy to leave it as it is. Taiwan goes to America to get its technology, which then transits to China. If they take back Taiwan, it becomes Chinese without the same freedom of access to U.S. technology and research labs. So why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? The Chinese are quite comfortable leaving Taiwan the way it is.
 <br><br>
Q: The nature of conflict is changing to an era of asymmetric warfare when one micro actor can neutralize or blunt a macro power. A few weeks ago, when five Iranian speedboats were darting in and out of three major U.S. warships steaming through the Strait of Hormuz, had they been loaded with super explosives, could have immobilized U.S. naval power the way al-Qaida attacked the USS Cole in Aden in October 2000.
 <br><br>
A: But again, can the Chinese land troops in Taiwan and establish and hold and widen a beachhead? The answer is no. Can they conquer Taiwan militarily? Again, no. They can only inflict damage.
 <br><br>
Q: But in the Gulf, if the U.S. and/or Israel bombed Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran has formidable asymmetrical retaliatory capabilities?
 <br><br>
A: But let me repeat, they cannot conquer you. Hezbollah cannot conquer Lebanon. They can create trouble for the non-Hezbollah Lebanese. So micro actors can cause a lot of trouble for your friends, but they can't eradicate them.
 <br><br>
UPI: Unless you've read science fiction, it's pretty hard to keep up with the ever-quickening pace of the revolution in technology. From the newfound ability to create artificial life to the now visible horizon of new supercomputers -- IBM's latest can compute at the rate of 1,000 trillion operations per second, up from 73 trillion -- that will surpass the human brain in every respect, to the current fusion of IT, biotech, nanotech and robotics. Humanity appears to be morphing from homo sapiens to homo connectus in one generation. Where do you see humankind going in the 21st century?
 <br><br>
Lee: I give up! Because I no longer understand, let alone relate. I didn't do science beyond high school, but at least I could understand the world around us, from totalitarian dictators out to rule the world to the pushback on freewheeling, anything-goes democracy. Now I read learned articles that don't tell me why all this new stuff is happening. I learn new words daily, like biopharmaceuticals and biologics and send them to my secretary for an explanation, and the answer comes back, from Google or somewhere on the Internet.
 <br><br>
When I was in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) recently, I was watching a BBC documentary, a sparkling, fascinating talk by Craig Ventner, the human genome scientist, who covered the whole field of tomorrow in 50 brilliant minutes. I was transfixed by the part about creating artificial life. But I can't figure out what it all means and where are we going.
 <br><br>
Q: You are not alone. Most political leaders in today's world have the same handicap. We already have 1 billion people online around the world and 2 billion mobile phones for 6.5 billion people, all providing information as well as disinformation, streaming video, chat rooms, blogs, which are rapidly reaching the 100 million mark. What does this tell you about the impact on democratic government, dictatorship and national sovereignty?
 <br><br>
A: I think national sovereignty will be around for a long while because it is the framework for activities between states. The alternative is a free-for-all chaos in the world. Suppose you have dozens of countries going through the kind of mayhem you now see in Kenya, all the technological paraphernalia in the world won't be of much help. It would be back to the Stone Age.
 <br><br>
Q: But as you were watching that BBC documentary what was going through your mind about where all this is leading?
 <br><br>
A: I do not buy the optimistic jargon about a new age of enlightenment. But as I watched Dr. Ventner's prediction about carbon-free fuel, I say then what? You can desalinate all the oceans of the world, then what? And we will still have the overpopulation problem. My conclusion is there are certain moral and physical limits to what mankind can do on this small planet. If you begin with human history from the earliest tribes, we still haven't moved beyond instinctive responses.
 <br><br>
Q: But what you were watching also told you that anyone born today will live to be 120 and productive almost until the end, and the 22nd century will see 250 years as a normal lifespan.
 <br><br>
A: And then what! It makes no sense. Three score and 10 is not a bad span. Lead a good productive life and leave the future to your progeny. I fear the future for my grandchildren may not be as good as ours was. In Singapore, we now have in our physically limited space 4.5 million people, 3.2 million of them our citizens, the rest foreigners who came to work here. Our planners are projecting 6.5 million. Our planners and demographers can already see 6.5 million. I said to them, "Look, go slow. It can't be done in our small city state."
 <br><br>
Q: Nanotechnology will enable us to build skyscrapers two to three times higher.
 <br><br>
A: Not while I'm still around.
 <br><br>
Q: You also have a brain drain?
 <br><br>
A: Yes, we're losing them to America.
 <br><br>
Q: Not China?
 <br><br>
A: No, there they have to compete against 1.3 billion people producing huge numbers of very bright people. They'd rather go to America where they become acclimatized, then go to China with an American firm. Chinese speakers, they are part of an American team with a leg up on their Chinese competitors. And from there, they can come back to Singapore with the kind of experience that puts them at the top of their game. Those who seek less rigorous competition, a more relaxed lifestyle, go to Canada and Australia.
 <br><br>
Q: How many top brains do you consider lost to Singapore every year?
 <br><br>
A: At the top end, about 1,000 a year. That's a loss of 4 percent or 5 percent. But compensating that, we have Chinese and Indians coming here looking for better prospects. So on balance, we're still gainers. But the day will come when China, in 30 or 40 years, will offer better prospects than any country in the world.
 <br><br>
Q: Switching to the future of capitalism the subprime mortgage predatory fiasco gave the entire world the vision of another great depression. Major banks in the U.S. and Europe lost close to $300 billion to this gigantic fraud.
 <br><br>
A: From time to time, smart crooks get the better of people. They skewer the system. I don't believe you can find a substitute for democratic capitalism. Let's not forget the human being's desire to do well for himself/herself, his/her spouse, kids, parents. And then, when you do well, have compassion for one's fellow human beings who are behind the curve. The system that maximizes this is the system that also gives the highest motivation to do better. Mao's China experimented with the idea of a new human being, the super worker. It was an abysmal failure. But even at the height of the Communist folly, I went to China and one of our escorts took off his Mao jacket to show us it was fur-lined, a sign he was doing better than the others. Therefore, not equal.
 <br><br>
I do not believe you can predict how human beings and societies will evolve. If we reach the point of global population saturation, we will have to craft new strategies to protect ourselves. Take Singapore. Yes, we want ASEAN, yes we want the European Union model. But supposing I said, "Yes, and we also want the Schengen Accord," which would mean any access to an Asian country in this new union would give you automatic, uncontrolled access to Singapore, and our people would laugh at me. There will, of course, be entities that will say to each other, "We're part of the same camp, or oasis, and we can share each other's assets." But I can't have people entering freely and setting up plastic tents in my garden. So when you reach an advanced state of development, what kind of an organization do you need? I frankly don't know.
 <br><br>
Q: So how do you see the future of capitalism?
 <br><br>
A: As chairman of the equivalent of our Sovereign Wealth Fund, we examine and decide where to invest our money, in equities or bonds or what have you. Our fund managers are paid five times what I get. Why? Because they have had good track records in growing our fund and we know what they could command in the private sector. They are dealing with billions of dollars every day and must be compensated accordingly.
 <br><br>
Unbridled capitalism, winner takes all like in America, does not work unless you can cope with an underclass. So here we also stay with the losers, make sure they have enough to live on, with healthcare, equal education opportunities for their children whose parents can no longer afford it. It's very important they not feel abandoned. So we have workfare and ingenuous ways to keep them working as we don't want layabouts doing nothing. We also subsidize homes which they would not be able to buy. A society can only survive if there is a sense of equity and fair play.
 <br><br>
Q: So to conclude, back to what concerns you most about the next 10 years, including WMD terrorism?
 <br><br>
A: First whether America will face this next rough patch without losing heart. Afghanistan cannot succeed as a democracy, nor as a new state defying centuries of tradition. To remake societies is beyond the capacity of any nation. America as a superpower has global responsibilities -- but that's not one of them. Utopias have no place in geopolitics.
