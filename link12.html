Book summary
My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore’s Bilingual Journey is the story of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s
50-year struggle to transform Singapore from a polyglot former British colony to a united
nation where everyone, while knowing English, knows also at least one other language,
his own mother tongue.
The founding prime minister of Singapore tells of why he did away with vernacular
schools in spite of violent political resistance, why he closed Nanyang University, why
he later started Special Assistance Plan schools, and why he continues to urge all
ethnic Chinese Singaporeans today to learn the Chinese language.
Along the way, we learn not only of the many policy adjustments but also the challenges
he encountered C from Chinese language chauvinists who wanted Chinese to be the
pre-eminent language in Singapore, from Malay and Tamil community groups fearing
that Chinese was being given too much emphasis, from parents of all races wanting an
easier time for their school-going children, even from his own Cabinet colleagues
questioning his assumptions about language.
We learn that there were four changes at the helm of the education ministry in four
months in 1975. We learn that there were Chinese-medium schools in Singapore right
up to the mid-1980s. We learn of the pain of “teachers who had to switch from teaching
in Chinese to teaching in English almost overnight”, and likewise that of students who
were “caught mid-stream” in the transition from a Chinese medium of instruction to an
English one. We learn why the National Day Rally of 1986 was a milestone and why he
“was a proud man that day”: For the first time since Singapore’s independence 21 years
earlier, the emcee for the event did not have to use three languages C Chinese, Malay
and Tamil C to lead the audience, as finally, English had become a language
understood by all Singaporeans.
My Lifelong Challenge is also the story of Mr Lee’s own personal struggle to learn the
Chinese language, which began when he was six years old and his Hakka maternal
grandmother enrolled him in a Chinese class with fishermen’s children. In evocative
detail, the man born to English-speaking parents recounts his own feelings of rebellion
and humiliation at different points in his life, when faced with the Chinese language and
his own inadequacy in it.

This book describes in matter-of-fact yet vivid fashion his steely determination to
improve his Chinese and reclaim his Chinese heritage, right up to the present when he
is well into his eighties. In this book, we learn of Mr Lee’s belief in a fundamental
difference between the Chinese-educated and the English-educated and how it came
about. He describes a scene of English-speaking students at the University of
Singapore hostel revelling in party games even as Chinese-speaking students in the
Chinese High School nearby were locked in a deadly face-off with the police in 1956,
and gives the dire warning that “if Singapore students all turned out like those in the
university hostel, Singapore would fail.” Finally, Mr Lee distils his experiences of 50
years into eight precepts which he spells out at the end of his narrative.
The second half of this book is a compilation of essays by 22 Singaporeans. They
include Mr Lee Hsien Loong, the current prime minister and son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
and Ms Stephanie Sun, the well-known pop star. In these essays, the 22 recount their
own language journeys, imbuing flesh and blood meaning to cold policy measures
wrought over more than four decades.
This book is essential reading for anyone wanting to find more about Singapore’s
bilingualism policy and its chief architect. It breaks new ground by putting into the public
domain information about education matters that has never been publicised. It is also an
invaluable resource for all who are interested in the primeval interplay between
language and politics.
Chinese make up 75 per cent of the population in Singapore, but Chinese language
cannot be the common language or working language for Singapore.
It is clear to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who had been prime minister for 31 years, that located
in Southeast Asia, Singapore is a Chinese island in a Malay Sea. Singapore must
ensure that it gets along well with its neighbours and be the master of its own destiny.
This is the guiding principle for all policies, including language policy. In Singapore,
language issues are political issues.
Before 1959, Chinese, Malay and Tamil schools were distinctively racial. Different
ethnic groups were isolated from and did not interact with each other. Like different
types of fish in an aquarium, they were together and yet separate.
When Singapore achieved self-government, the most urgent task for the government
was to remove these barriers or at least break them down.

When we became independent in 1965, English was made the main language to
overcome the political and social situation of the four linguistic groups keeping to
themselves, allowing them to compete openly and fairly.
Apart from the geopolitical reality of "a Chinese island in a Malay Sea", Mr Lee also
chose English as our common language for us to survive and grow.
Disadvantaged by a lack of natural resources, he knows Singapore must quickly master
English to link up with the world to have access to foreign capital and technology
necessary for economic development. Put simply, it is a question of survival.
There are many advantages to English being the language of instruction. Nevertheless,
this has also weakened a new generation of Singaporeans' command of their mother
tongue and unavoidably, their identification with their own culture.
Just learning Chinese as mother tongue would jeopardise our survival. Knowing only
English could cost us our cultural identity and national pride. Mr Lee is convinced that
the bilingual policy is the best strategy for us to compete as well as a pillar in nation
building.
There is no precedent for such a policy and we cannot draw on the experience of other
countries. We have to learn along the way.
Political pressure makes its hard for the government to find a balance between English
and Chinese - it's like a tug-of-war. Both major and minor adjustments have also been
made in response to changing circumstances. The book details the difficult challenges
in implementing English-Chinese bilingual education in Singapore in the last 50 years.
Some of the thinking and decision-making process which have never been disclosed
are now revealed through Mr Lee's eight interviews with journalists from Lianhe Zaobao
and The Straits Times.
